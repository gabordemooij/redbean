	 * A logger (for \PDO or OCI driver) needs to implement the log method.
	 * The log method will receive logging data. Note that the number of parameters is 0, this means
	 * all parameters are optional and the number may vary. This way the logger can be used in a very
	 * flexible way. Sometimes the logger is used to log a simple error message and in other
	 * situations sql and bindings are passed.
	 * The log method should be able to accept all kinds of parameters and data by using
	 * functions like func_num_args/func_get_args.
