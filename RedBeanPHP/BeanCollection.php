/**
 * BeanCollection.
 *
 * The BeanCollection represents a collection of beans and
 * makes it possible to use database cursors. The BeanCollection
 * has a method next() to obtain the first, next and last bean
 * in the collection. The BeanCollection does not implement the array
 * interface nor does it try to act like an array because it cannot go
 * backward or rewind itself.
 *
 * Use the BeanCollection for large datasets where skip/limit is not an
 * option. Keep in mind that ID-marking (querying a start ID) is a decent
 * alternative though.
