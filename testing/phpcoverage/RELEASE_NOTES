Spike PHPCoverage Release Notes
===============================

Version 0.8.2
===================

 * Known Issues
 --------------
   1. Incorrect execution frequency
      The code coverage execution frequency for some of the PHP lines may
      not be correct. Xdebug has changed its implementation to only return 1
      for executed lines. Currently, there is no time frame for fixing this issue in 
      Spike PHPCoverage.

   2. It takes a long time to generate code coverage report for large sized 
      applications.

   3. The "--cov-data-file" option in cli/driver.php has been changed to 
      "--cov-data-files" and accepts a comma-separated list of coverage recording
      xml files. It will then generate a report after merging the data.
