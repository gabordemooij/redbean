<h1>Quick Tour</h1>
<p>
In this <b>Quick Tour</b> we will show you
how to use <b>RedBeanPHP</b> and highlight some of its features.
<br>
Because your time is precious, the Quick Tour is very brief and should only take about
<b>5 minutes</b> to walk through...
</p> 
<h2>Quick Tour in 10 seconds</h2>
<p>
	Have an associative array in PHP? You can store an entire
	array structure (even from a form) in one line:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::store(R::dispense([
		'_type' => 'book',
        	'title' => 'My Book',
        	'ownPageList' => [
                	['_type'=>'page', 'name'=>'first page']
        	]
	]));

"); ?>
<p>
	This creates a book table with one entry called 'My Book' and a related page
	(using proper foreign keys). ...8...9...10. :)
</p>
<h2>Quick Tour in 5 minutes... minute 1:</h2>
<p>
To begin with RedBeanPHP,
<a href="/download" title="download">download</a> the package from the website and
put in somewhere in your PHP project (check the signature).
</p>
<p>
Now, before you begin you have to <i>include</i> RedBeanPHP in your project,
to do so, add a line like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	require 'rb.php';
");?>
<h2>Minute 2: Create a database</h2>
<p>
Now you have to setup your <i>database connection</i>.<br>
If you just want to play with RedBeanPHP you may also use:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::setup();
");?>
<p>
This will create a simple, <b>temporary</b> <b>SQLite</b> database, after rebooting
your system this database will be <b>gone</b>.
</p>

<p class="note">
 For Windows users: make sure PHP has write access to C:\Windows\Temp.
</p>

<p>
If you want to start using RedBeanPHP for <b>real</b>, you can connect to a
<b>MySQL</b> database like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::setup( 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase', 'myusername', 'mypassword' );
");?>
<h2>Minute 3: Beans</h2>
<p>
Now you're ready to start using RedBeanPHP. RedBeanPHP makes it really easy to store stuff
in the database. For instance, to store a blog post in the database you write:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$post = R::dispense( 'post' );
	\$post->title = 'My holiday';
	\$id = R::store( \$post );
");?>
<p>
Now, RedBeanPHP will <b>create</b> a <b>table</b> called post for you in the database and add
a <b>column</b> called <b>title</b>, big enough to hold your text.
<br>
The store() function will also
return the <b>primary key ID</b> of the record, which we capture in the variable <i>$id</i>.
</p>
<p class="note">
	RedBeanPHP automatically creates a column for your property, in this case 'title'.
	RedBeanPHP determines the column type by scanning the value in the property.
	For instance in this case the value is a small text, so RedBeanPHP will add a column
	of type <b>VARCHAR</b> (assuming this is a <b>MySQL/MariaDB</b> database). Imagine you store
	a large text in this property later, then RedBeanPHP will change the column type to <b>TEXT</b>
	to make room for the new value. This is called <b>fluid</b> mode. In fluid mode, RedBeanPHP
	will <i>adapt</i> the database to meet the requirements of your app. It will never throw away
	columns though nor will it ever shrink the size of a column, so you don't have to worry about
	data loss. If you want to clean up your database by removing columns you have to do this
	manually. Some datatypes are <i>immutable</i>, for instance if you store an ISO date string in a
	property (2005-01-01), RedBeanPHP will create a date column for you. However in this case, the
	date column will not change (to TEXT for example). This is because we consider it unlikely you ever
	want to change a date column into something else (like a <b>TEXT</b> column). If you try to
	put an invalid date string into this column RedBeanPHP assumes it's by accident.
</p>
<p>
Note that you don't need any configuration to make this work. RedBeanPHP is
<b>configurationless</b>, everything just works out of the box.
You also don't need to configure <b>paths</b> or <b>autoloaders</b> because 
everything is just in <b>one file</b>!<br>
You don't even have to <b>instantiate an object</b>, all methods in RedBeanPHP are <i>static</i>.
<br>
Just type <b>R::</b> and then the name of the <i>method</i> you want to use!
</p>
<p>
To <b>load</b> the post you just saved, just pass the <b>ID</b> to the
load function:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$post = R::load( 'post', \$id );
");?>

<p class="note" id="loadForUpdate">
	If you want to lock a bean while loading it, so nobody can change
	the record associated with your bean until your transaction completes use
	R::loadForUpdate()/R::findForUpdate() instead (version 5+).
	<br><br>
	You can also use SQL snippets like <b>' for update '</b>
	with operations like R::find() and R::batch(). Before invoking these commands
	just set the SQL snippet you wish to use:<br>
	<br>
	<b>R::getWriter()-&gt;setSQLSelectSnippet( ... );</b>
</p>
<p>
Yep, there's your post again. To <b>echo</b> the title of your post:
</p>
<?php code("
	echo \$post->title;
");?>
<p>
Nothing fancy there, but did you know beans can also be treated like <b>arrays</b> ?
</p>
<?php code("
	echo \$post['title'];
");?>
<p>
To <b>delete</b> your post, pass it to the <b>trash</b> method:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::trash( \$post );
");?>
<p>
Now, the post is gone, it will no longer be available in your database.
</p>
<h2>Minute 4: Finding stuff</h2>
<p>
Finding stuff in the database is <b>easy</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$posts = R::find(
	'post', ' title LIKE ?', [ 'holiday' ] );
");?>
<p>
This will <b>search</b> for all posts have the word 'holiday' in the title and will
return an array containing all the relevant beans as a result.
As you see, we don't use a fancy query builder, just <b>good old SQL</b>.
<br>
We like to keep things simple.
</p>
<p>
Besides using the find() functions, you can also use <b>raw</b> SQL queries:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books = R::getAll(
	'SELECT * FROM book WHERE price < ? ',
	[ 50 ] );
");?>
<h2>Minute 5: Relations</h2>
<p>
RedBeanPHP also makes it easy to manage <b>relations</b>. For instance, if we like
to add some photos to our holiday post we do this:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$post->ownPhotoList[] = \$photo1;
	\$post->ownPhotoList[] = \$photo2;
	R::store( \$post );
");?>
<p>
Here, <i>$photo1</i> and <i>$photo2</i> are also beans (but of <b>type</b> <i>'photo'</i>). 
<br>
After storing the
post, these photos will be associated with the blog post. 
<br>
To associate a bean you
simply <b>add</b> it to a list.
The name of the list <b>must match</b> the name of the related bean <b>type</b>.
<br>
So <b>photo</b> beans go in: 
<br><br>
$post-&gt;own<b>Photo</b>List
<br><br>
<b>comments</b> go in:
<br><br>
$post-&gt;own<b>Comment</b>List 
<br><br>
and <b>notes</b> go in:
<br><br>
$post-&gt;own<b>Note</b>List
<br><br>
See? It's that simple!
</p>
<p>
To <b>retrieve</b> associated beans, just <b>access</b> the corresponding list:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$post = R::load( 'post', \$id );
	\$firstPhoto = reset( \$post->ownPhotoList );
");?>
<p>
In the example above, we load the blog post and then access the list.
The <i>moment</i> we <b>access</b> the <b>ownPhotoList</b> property, the relation will be loaded <b>automatically</b>,
this is often called <b>lazy loading</b>, because RedBeanPHP only loads the beans when you really need them.
</p>
<p>
To get the <b>first element</b> of the photo list, we simply use PHP's native <b>reset()</b> function...
</p>
<?php code("
	\$firstPost = reset( \$post->ownPhotoList );
");?>
<p>
Although <b>no SQL</b> is necessary, RedBeanPHP is very <b>SQL friendly</b>. For instance, suppose some of
your posts have quite a big photo collection associated with it and you want to <b>limit</b> the number
of photos to a maximum of 3:
</p>

<?php code("
	\$threePhotos = \$post->with( 'LIMIT 3' )->ownPhotoList;
");?>

<p>
See? Just pass a little <b>SQL Snippet</b>!
<p>

<h2>Final note</h2>
<p>
As you have seen, RedBeanPHP dynamically changes the structure of the database during development.
This is a very nice feature, but you don't want that to happen on your <b>production server</b>! So, before
deploying your <b>app</b>, be sure to <i>freeze</i> the database by adding the following line just below the setup:
</p>

<?php code("
	R::freeze( TRUE );
");?>

<p>
Before you deploy, <b>review</b> your database schema. RedBeanPHP tries to make a <b>good</b> database schema for
you, but you might want to improve it.<br>
Maybe you added a column you no longer use, or you want an extra index.
<br>
Always make sure you review the final database schema before you put it on a production server!
<br>
After freezing the database, RedBeanPHP will
no longer change the structure, so you have the best of both worlds. <b>NoSQL-like</b> flexibility during development and
a <b>reliable schema</b> on your production server!
</p>

<p>
This was just a quick tour, showcasing some basic usage of RedBeanPHP. For more details please explore the
documentation on this website!
</p>


<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>
	<b>Short</b> version first... minimal requirements
</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU/Linux, BSD, Windows, macOS</li>
<li>PHP 5.3.0 or higher (PHP 5.3.4+ recommended)</li>
<li>PDO plus driver for your database</li>
<li>Multibyte String Support</li>
</ul>


<h2>PHP versions</h2>
<p>
	<strong>RedBeanPHP</strong>
	requires PHP 5.3.4 or higher.
	RedBeanPHP is works on both ZEND PHP and HHVM.<br>
	RedBeanPHP also works with <b>PHP 7</b>.
	You can also use RedBeanPHP with PHP 5.3 - 5.3.3, just make sure
	you run the <a href="/install#p533patch" title="P533Patch">p533 patch</a> first.
	<b>PHP 5.2</b> and earlier are <b>not</b> supported by RedBeanPHP. If you
	happen to work with PHP 5.2 or earlier it's recommended to upgrade to a
	newer version of PHP.
	<br>
	<b>PHP 6.0</b> is also <b>not</b> supported, since this version has never
	been officially released. Still, some people have been e-mailing me about
	PHP 6.0. Although RedBeanPHP officially does not support this version, it is
	said to work <i>'reasonably'</i>.
</p>



<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP works on all well known operating systems, including
	<b>GNU/Linux</b>, <b>BSD</b> and <b>Mac OSX</b>.
	<br>
	You need to have <abbr title="PHP Data Objects">PDO</abbr> installed and you need
	a PDO driver for the database you want to connect to. Most PHP stacks
	already take care of this.
	<br>
	RedBeanPHP also requires the MB String extension, once
	again, chances are, this is already there.
</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP supports all <b>well known</b>, <b>open source</b>,
	<b>relational databases</b>. Official support is provided for:
	<a title="MySQL" href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>,
	<a title="MariaDB" href="https://mariadb.org/" target="_blank">MariaDB</a>,
	<a title="PostgreSQL" href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>,
	<a title="SQLite" href="https://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite</a>,
	<a title="CUBRID" href="http://www.cubrid.org/" target="_blank">CUBRID</a> and
	<a title="Firebird/Interbase" href="https://firebirdsql.org/" target="_blank">Firebird/Interbase</a> (experimental).
	Support for other databases might be provided by 3rd parties.
</p>



<h2>MySQL Strict Mode</h2>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP does <b>not</b> work with <b>MySQL strict mode</b>.
	To turn off strict mode execute the following SQL query:
</p>
<?php code("
	SET @@global.sql_mode= '';
");?>

<h2>Existing schemas</h2>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP has been designed to build your database <b>on-the-fly</b>, as you go.
	Afterwards, you can <b>manually</b> change the schema to suit your needs (change column types, add additional indexes).
	Remember that the purpose of RedBeanPHP is to have an easy, configuration-less ORM. This can be achieved only by
	respecting certain conventions.
</p>

<h2>Ready to download?</h2>
<p>
	Did you check your system requirements? Proceed to
	<a href="/download" title="Download Page.">download RedBeanPHP</a>.
</p>



<h1>Install</h1>

<p>
	Installing RedBeanPHP is very easy.
	First of all, you need to download the <i>tarball</i> from our server.
	Just head over to the download section and click on the download link to
	start downloading the package. You can also use a tool like <b>wget</b> of course.
</p>



<h2>Simple installation</h2>

<kbd style="overflow-x:scroll">
curl -L https://redbeanphp.com/downloadredbeanversion.php?f=all-drivers | signify -Vz -p ./red.pub -t arc | tar xvzf -
</kbd>
<p>
	This will automatically download RedBeanPHP, verify the signature and (see download page) and
	extract the contents of the package.
</p>

<kbd style="overflow-x:scroll">
url=http://www.redbeanphp.com/downloadredbean.php<br>
wget $url --output-document=&quot;redbeanphp.tar.gz&quot;<br>
tar xvf redbeanphp.tar.gz 
</kbd>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP is always distributed as a <b>TGZ</b> package, also known
	as a <i>'tarball'</i>. To extract the contents of this package use:
</p>
<kbd>
tar xvf redbeanphp.tar.gz
</kbd>
<p>
	You'll then see...
</p>
<kbd>
license.txt<br>
rb.php
</kbd>
<p>
	<b>OPTIONAL</b>
	Check integrity:
</p>
<kbd>
sha256sum redbean.tgz
</kbd>
<p>
	Now compare the output of that command with the SHA signature shown
	on the download pages.
</p>


<p>
	<b>OPTIONAL</b>
	Check authenticity (public keys available on download page and groups forum):
</p>


<kbd>
cat redbean.tgz | signify -Vz -p red.pub -t arc | tar xvzf -
</kbd>
	
<p>
	Inside the package you'll find a <b>license.txt</b> and a <b>rb.php</b> file.
	The first file contains the license information. The second file is the
	compiled RedBeanPHP all-in-one script. All RedBeanPHP code has been
	<b>combined</b> into a <b>single file</b> for your convenience.
</p>

<h2>Including in your project</h2>

<p>
	To include RedBeanPHP in your project, simply copy the file to
	a location somewhere inside your PHP project and then use
	the PHP <i>'require'</i> command to load it:
</p>

<?php code("
	require 'rb.php';
"); ?>
<p>
	You are now ready to use RedBeanPHP! <br>
	Let's try to setup
	<a href="/connection" title="Learn how to connect to a database using RedBeanPHP!">a database connection</a>!
</p>

<h2 id="p533patch">Patch for PHP 5.3.3 and earlier</h2>
<p>
	<b>This patch is only required for people using old versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 5.3.3 or earlier</b>.
	If you are running a PHP instance with a higher version number please skip this section.
	People using PHP version 5.3.3 or older should run the p533patch.php file first and then
	include the newly generated rb-p533.php file. The patch will modify the source for compatibility with these older
	PHP editions. Use the patch like this:
</p>
<kbd>
	php p533patch.php
</kbd>
<p>
	You will now see the following output:
</p>
<kbd>
	Running Patch P533...<br>
	Applied patch for PHP &lt; 5.3.3
</kbd>
<p>
	After running the patch, you'll see a new file in your folder:
</p>
<kbd>
	rb-p533.php
</kbd>
<p>
	This is the file to be used with your version of PHP.
</p>

<h2>Composer</h2>

<p class="note" style="color:red">
Composer is <b>not</b> the preferred way to install RedBeanPHP and never will be. Using package management systems for
development can be <b>dangerous</b> because people can inject malicious dependencies or remove dependencies.

</p>



<h1>Connection</h1>
<p>
	To connect to an <b>SQLite</b> testing database,
	without having to make one yourself, use:
</p>

<?php code("
	require 'rb.php';
	R::setup();
"); ?>

<p>
	On most systems, this just works.
	<br>
	This code creates a test database in your <b>/tmp</b> folder.
	<br>
	Of course, this is meant for testing purposes only
	(and to fool around),
	to connect to a real database, use one of the following snippets:
</p>

<p class="note">
 For <b>Windows</b>: make sure PHP has write access to <b>C:\Windows\Temp</b>.
</p>

<h2>MariaDB</h2>
<p>
	MariaDB (formerly known as <b>MySQL</b>) is the most popular database among web developers.
	Use MariaDB or MySQL for <b>light</b> web development.
	To connect to a
	<a target="_blank" href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/a-mariadb-primer-01-intro/" title="Learn more about the MySQL database">MySQL</a> database or a
	MariaDB database:
</p>

<?php code("
	R::setup( 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase',
		'user', 'password' ); //for both mysql or mariaDB
")?>

<p class="note">
	Did you manage to establish a connection to the database?
	Proceed to learn the
	<a href="/crud" title="Basic RedBeanPHP">basics</a>
	of RedBeanPHP!
</p>

<p class="note">
	Did you receive a connection error?<br>
	Note that PDO errors are not passed to the client as under certain circumstances they can reveal secrets (such as passwords). To see exact error messages you must create a direct PDO connection without RedBeanPHP. A sample is shown below:
</p>

<?php code("
	try{
		\$db = new PDO('mysql:host=HOSTNAME;dbname=DB_NAME','USERNAME','PASSWORD');
	} catch(PDOException \$e){
		echo \$e->getmessage();
	}
");?>

<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>
	Postgres  evolved from the classic Ingres database and is by far the most advanced database
	you can get. Use Postgres for serious application development. Postgres is rock solid and
	has lots of power features like window functions, support for hierarchical queries and materialized views.
	To connect to a
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/tutorial-start.html" title="Learn more about Postgres database">PostgreSQL</a> database:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::setup( 'pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase',
		'user', 'password' );
");?>

<h2>SQLite</h2>
<p>
	SQLite is file based database, ideal for embedded applications, prototyping, small (and smart) applications,
	small websites (not too much traffic) and data analysis.
	To connect to an
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sqlite.org/quickstart.html" title="Read more about SQLite">SQLite</a> database:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::setup( 'sqlite:/tmp/dbfile.db' );
"); ?>

<h2>CUBRID</h2>
<p>
	CUBRID is an exciting database platform focusing on web development.
	It's an ideal replacement for rusty MySQL servers. While CUBRID seems to be almost
	completely compatible with MySQL it also offers a great deal of advanced features, like hierarchical queries and
	<b>click counters</b>. However, CUBRID
	also offers a very complete, easy-to-use GUI based toolchain.
	To use the
	<a target="_blank" title="Learn more about the CUBRID database" href="http://www.cubrid.org/wiki_tutorials/entry/cubrid-tutorials">CUBRID</a>
	database with RedBeanPHP4, first install the
	<a target="_blank" title="Download the plugin pack for RedBeanPHP4" href="https://github.com/gabordemooij/RB4Plugins">plugin pack</a>.
	To connect to a CUBRID database:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::setup('cubrid:host=localhost;port=30000;
	dbname=mydatabase',
    'user','password');
"); ?>




<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>

<p>
	To disconnect use:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::close();
");?>
<p>
	This will close the database connection.
</p>


<h1>Tutorial</h1>

<p>
	
	<img style="float:right;margin:10px;border-radius:100%;" src="/img/whisky_in_devilsadvocate.jpg" alt="Picture of a glass of Whisky, taken in Devils Advocate, Edinburgh.">
	In this tutorial we're going to write a little
	application to demonstrate some <b>basic features</b> of RedBeanPHP.
	Instead of a boring <i>todo app</i>, we'll write a little application
	to manage <i>whisky tasting notes</i>. We call this application 
	<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dram_%28unit%29" title="Dram">'dram'</a>
	which is 'a small glass of whisky'.
	<br><br><br><br><br>
	
</p>

<h2>The Environment</h2>
<p>
	We'll build a <b>CLI</b> application. This means we don't create
	a graphical user interface. Our application will run on the command line.
	This allows us to focus solely on the program code
	without having to bother with things like HTML templates.
	We also assume you're using a <b>UNIX</b> or <b>GNU/Linux</b>
	operating system.
</p>


<h2>Step 1: Setup</h2>
<p>
	First, we need to <b>download</b> and <b>install</b> the RedBeanPHP
	package. Luckily, this is a no-brainer. RedBeanPHP is distributed
	as a single file which we just grab from the internet like this:
</p>
<kbd style="overflow-x:scroll">
	url=http://www.redbeanphp.com/downloadredbean.php<br>
	wget $url --output-document="redbeanphp.tar.gz"<br>
	tar xvf redbeanphp.tar.gz
</kbd>
<p>
	Here we download the RedBeanPHP package from the RedBeanPHP servers.
	We then extract the contents of the <b>tarball</b>. RedBeanPHP is always
	distributed as a single tarball containing the single code file.
	The code file inside the tarball is named:
</p>
<kbd>
	rb.php
</kbd>
<p>
	For this tutorial, we'll use a temporary database, so after <b>rebooting</b>
	your system, the data will be <b>gone</b>.<br>
	While not very practical in real life, this
	is ideal for testing and playing with RedBeanPHP.
	So, let's create our application, the <b>dram.php</b> file:
</p>
<kbd>
	touch dram.php
</kbd>
<p>
	...and we're going to edit it using our favourite editor...
</p>
<kbd>
	vim dram.php
</kbd>
<p>
	I like to use <b>VIM</b> but that's of course just a matter of choice.
	Any plaintext editor would do fine of course.<br>
	Now, let's require the RedBeanPHP library file and setup our
	database connection:
</p>
<?php code("
	require 'rb.php';
	R::setup();	
"); ?>
<p>
	That's all, we're now ready to start coding now.
</p>


<h2>Step 2: Let's add a bottle of whisky</h2>
<p>
	When working with RedBeanPHP, it's important to start by <b>creating</b>
	records first. So first write your logic for adding records to the database.
	Some people like to begin by
	creating an overview page listing all the records in a table,
	however this means your <i>database</i>
	must already contain at least <i>some</i> data.<br>
	Since we like RedBeanPHP to do all the
	heavy lifting for us, including <i>table</i> and <i>column</i> creation, 
	we better start the other way around, by adding records.
	So, always start with your 'add' code.
</p>
<?php code("
	\$opts = getopt( '', [ 'add:', 'list' ] );
"); ?>
<p>
	We use the <b>getopt()</b> function of PHP to read commands
	from the console.<br>
	In this case we listen for two commands: <b>add</b> and <b>list</b>.<br>
	Now let's see how we add a bottle of whisky to our collection:
</p>
<?php code("
	if ( isset( \$opts['add'] ) ) {
	\$w = R::dispense( 'whisky' );
	\$w->name = \$opts['add'];
	\$id = R::store( \$w );
	die( \"OK.\\n\" );
	}
");?>
<p>
	This code works very simple: it takes the value of the <i>add</i> 
	parameter from the command
	line and creates a new <b>bean</b> of type whisky. It then puts the text in the
	name property of the bean and stores it. To make it possible for our
	users to view the whisky menu we also implement a <b>list</b> feature:
</p>
<?php code("
	if ( isset( \$opts['list'] ) ) {
  		\$bottles = R::find( 'whisky' );
  		if ( !count( \$bottles ) )
			die( \"The cellar is empty!\\n\" );
  		foreach( \$bottles as \$b ) {
    		echo \"* #{\$b->id}: {\$b->name}\\n\";
  		}
  	exit;
	}
");?>
<p>
	We can now use the application like this:
</p>
<kbd>
	php dram.php --add=&quot;Bowmore 12yo&quot;<br>
	OK.<br>
	php dram.php --add=&quot;Lagavulin 16yo&quot;<br>
	OK.
</kbd>
<p>
	...and to view the list...
</p>
<kbd>
	php dram.php --list<br>
	* #1: Bowmore 12yo<br>
	* #2: Lagavulin 16yo
</kbd>
<p>
	That's already quite a fancy application in just a couple of lines.
	But we can do more! However, before we continue, let's take a look
	at the database. Before we began, it was empty, but now we see this:
</p>
<kbd>
geek@beans$ sqlite3 /tmp/red.db<br>
SQLite version 3.7.13 2025-06-11 02:05:22<br>
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for instructions<br>
Enter SQL statements terminated with a &quot;;&quot;<br>
sqlite&gt; .tables<br>
whisky<br>
</kbd>
<p>
	We see the whisky table has been created. The required columns are there as well:
</p>
<kbd>
sqlite&gt; .schema<br>
CREATE TABLE `whisky` (<br>
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT ,<br>
`name` TEXT<br>
);<br>
</kbd>

<p class="note">
	RedBeanPHP creates the necessary <b>tables</b> and <b>columns</b> automatically.
	The <b>type</b> of the column in the database depends on the value you want to store in it.
	RedBeanPHP <i>scans</i> the value you want to store in a column and makes sure the column has
	a type that can contain your data properly. You can always <b>tune</b> your database schema
	manually of course.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Throwing bottles away</h2>
<p>
	We are now going to add a new feature: <i>'delete'</i>.
	Not suprising, the delete command will remove a specific
	record from the database. First we add the 'delete' command
	to getopts, so our application can recognize this command:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$opts = getopt( '', ['add:', 'list', 'delete:' ] );
"); ?>
<p>
	Next, we write a little code to perform the actual
	deletion:
</p>
<?php code("
	if ( isset( \$opts['delete'] ) ) {
	R::trash( 'whisky', \$opts['delete'] );
	die( \"Threw the bottle away!\\n\" );
	}
");?>
<p>
	Nice, so we can now add, list and delete whiskies! Let's give it
	a try!
</p>
<kbd>
	php dram.php --add=&quot;daluaine 16yo&quot;<br>
	OK.<br>
	php dram.php --list<br>
	* #1: Bowmore 12yo<br>
	* #3: Daluaine 16yo<br>
</kbd>
<p>
	Oops, a typo, it's <b>Dailuaine</b> not Daluaine. A delicious whisky by the way.
	Thanks to our new delete function, we can now remove this faulty record and correct
	our silly mistake:
</p>
<kbd>
	php dram.php --delete=3<br>
	Threw the bottle away!<br>
	php dram.php --list<br>
	* #1: Bowmore 12yo<br>
	php dram.php --add=&quot;Dailuaine 16yo&quot;<br>
</kbd>
<p>
	Now this is all nice and fun but where are the notes?
	It's supposed to be a tasting <b>notes</b> app after all?
	So, let's add the notes before the 
	<a 
	target="_blank" 
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis"
	title="Haggis">Haggis</a> gets cold!
</p>
<h2>Step 4: Adding some tasting notes</h2>
<p>
	Let's first consider the relation between a <b>tasting note</b> and
	a <b>bottle of whisky</b>. A whisky bottle can have <b>many</b> tasting notes, yes?
	Right, so what about the other way around? Can <b>one</b> tasting note
	belong to many <b>whiskies</b>? Unlikely, since we consider every whisky to have
	a unique taste (except the very cheap stuff maybe).<br>
	This means we need a <b>one-to-many</b>
	relation here.<br>
	<b>One</b> whisky has <b>many</b> notes, each of these notes belongs to <b>one</b> whisky.
	This kind of relation is sometimes expressed as: <i>1-N</i>.
	Now, when we throw away a bottle of whisky because we are no longer interested in it,
	should we keep the corresponding notes? No! of course not! The notes themselves are not of
	any interest, they only matter in relation to the whisky they describe. This means we have
	to use an <b>exclusive own list</b>: xownNoteList. We relate the note and the whisky like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$n = R::dispense( 'note' );
	\$n->note = \$text;
	\$whisky->xownNoteList[] = \$n;
	R::store( \$whisky );
	");?>
<p>
	Note that the name of the list contains the type of bean we're storing in it.
	This is by convention. The format for a list is:
</p>
<kbd>
	&lt;x&gt; own &lt;BEAN TYPE NAME&gt; List
</kbd>
<p>
	So if we want to store pages in a book we use <b>ownPageList</b>.
	Because we want to throw the notes away with the bottle, we use an <b>exclusive</b> list.
	Therefore we begin the name of this list with an <b>'x'</b>. Once an exclusive list has been
	defined, there is no way back. If you want the notes to stay after all, you'll have to
	open your database management tool (<i>phpmyadmin</i>) and change the <b>foreign key</b> setting.
</p>
<p>
	Now, let's make a feature for our users to list all the notes attached to
	a certain bottle of whisky:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$notes = \$whisky->xownNoteList;
	foreach( \$notes as \$note ) echo \$note->note;
"); ?>
<h2>Step 5: Wrapping up</h2>
<p>
	Now let's take a look at the whole application, here is my version:
</p>
<?php code("
	require 'rb.php';
	R::setup();
	\$opts = getopt( '', [
	  'add:',
	  'delete:',
	  'attach-to:',
	  'note:',
	  'notes:',
	  'remove-note:',
	  'list' ] );
	if ( isset( \$opts [ 'add' ] ) ) {
	  \$w = R::dispense( 'whisky' );
	  \$w->name = \$opts['add'];
	  \$id = R::store( \$w );
	  die( \"OK.\\n\" );
	}
	if ( isset( \$opts['delete'] ) ) {
	  R::trash( 'whisky', \$opts['delete'] );
	  die( \"Threw the bottle away!\\n\" );
	}
	if ( isset( \$opts['note'] ) && isset( \$opts['attach-to'] ) ) {
	  \$w = R::load( 'whisky', \$opts['attach-to'] );
	  if (!\$w->id) die( \"No such bottle.\\n\" );
	  \$n = R::dispense( 'note' );
	  \$n->note = \$opts['note'];
	  \$w->xownNoteList[] = \$n;
	  R::store( \$w );
	  die( \"Added note to whisky.\\n\" );
	}
	if ( isset( \$opts['notes'] ) ) {
	\$w = R::load( 'whisky', \$opts['notes'] );
	foreach( \$w->xownNoteList as \$note ) {
	echo \"* #{\$note->id}: {\$note->note}\\n\";
	}
 	 exit;
	}
	if ( isset( \$opts['remove-note'] ) ) {
	R::trash( 'note', \$opts['remove-note'] );
  	die( \"Removed note.\\n\" );	
	}
	if ( isset( \$opts['list'] ) ) {
 	\$bottles = R::find( 'whisky' );
	if ( !count( \$bottles ) ) die( \"The cellar is empty!\\n\" );
	foreach( \$bottles as \$b ) {
	echo \"* #{\$b->id}: {\$b->name}\\n\";
	}
	exit;
	}
"); ?>
<p>
	Here is how to use it:
</p>
<kbd>
php dram.php --add=&quot;Dailuaine 16yo&quot;<br>
OK.<br>
php dram.php --list<br>
* #1: Bowmore 12yo<br>
* #4: Dailuaine 16yo<br>
php dram.php --attach-to=4 --note=&quot;vanilla, buttered cream&quot;<br>
Added note to whisky.<br>
php dram.php --attach-to=4 --note=&quot;apple, pear&quot;<br>
Added note to whisky.<br>
php dram.php --notes=4<br>
* #4: vanilla, buttered cream<br>
* #5: apple, pear
</kbd>

<h2>Step 6: Playing with models</h2>
<p>
	Just for fun, we're going to add a <b>model</b>.
	In many web application using the <abbr title="Model View Controller">MVC</abbr> pattern, models are used
	to encapsulate the business rules. Now let's say we don't accept
	tasting notes containing less than four characters. This
	qualifies as a business rule in the drinking business :).
	To add this <b>validation</b> rule we need to have a model.
	In most <b>object relational mappers</b> this is why you have
	to create a whole class first. In RedBeanPHP we like to things a
	little different. We have <b>no models</b> remember? Just <b>beans</b>.
	So, how do we go from a <i>bean</i> to a <i>model</i> ? Simple, we just
	add a model and RedBeanPHP will <b>automatically</b> detect its presence.
	Based on the <i>naming convention</i> it will connect the model to the bean.
	Here we go:
</p>
<?php code("
	class Model_Note extends RedBean_SimpleModel {
		public function update() {
		if ( strlen( \$this->bean->note ) < 4 ) 
		die( \"Note is too short!\\n\" );
		}
	}
");?>
<p>
	Within the note model we can refer to our bean using:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$this->bean;
");?>
<p>
	The <b>update()</b> method will be invoked by the bean once we try to store it.
	There is no way to stop the code flow though, to prevent RedBeanPHP from storing the bean
	we have to throw an <b>exception</b>, or issue a <i>die()</i> statement. Let's test it:
</p>
<kbd>
php dram.php --attach-to=4 --note="ap"<br>
Note is too short!
</kbd>
<p>
	Nice! That works really well! See? We did not have to <b>change</b> our code,
	simply add models whenever you like. No need to take all your code, put it in a class
	or add validation rules here and there, no, just add the model and suddenly all actions
	will flow <i>through</i> it.
	Besides <b>update()</b> we can use a lot of other <i>'hooks'</i>
	to do all sorts of model stuff.
</p>
<h2>Step 7: Freezing</h2>
<p>
	Before we <b>deploy</b> our application, we need to review the database and <i>freeze</i> it.
	To freeze the database we simply invoke the <i>freeze()</i>
	method on top of our code, just below the <i>setup line</i>:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::setup();
	R::freeze( TRUE );
");?>
<p>
	That's it, we have our whisky app!<br>
	Of course there's much more to RedBeanPHP than just doing <b>CRUD</b>
	and <b>one-to-many</b> relations, but it's
	nearly impossible to fit all those features in a single tutorial.<br>
	Feel free to extend this little app
	with <b>tags</b>, <b>categories</b>
	and other concepts to explore all the other features RedBeanPHP has to offer. <b>Enjoy!</b>

<h1>CRUD</h1>
<p>
	CRUD stands for <b>C</b>reate, <b>U</b>pdate, <b>R</b>etrieve and <b>D</b>elete.
	CRUD operations are the core of many web applications.
</p>

<h2>Working with beans</h2>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP works with beans. Most interactions with the <b>database</b> are
	accomplished using beans. Beans are used to carry data from and to the database.
	<br><br >
	Every bean has a <b>type</b> and an <b>ID</b>.
	The type of a bean tells you which <b>table</b> in the database is used to store the bean.
	Every type maps to a corresponding table. The ID of a bean is the <b>primary key</b>
	of the corresponding <b>record</b>.
	<br>
	You can create a new bean by dispensing one.
</p>

<h2 id="dispense">Create</h2>
<p>
	To create a new bean (of type 'book') use:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book = R::dispense( 'book' );
"); ?>
<p>
	You can now add properties:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book->title = 'Learn to Program';
	\$book->rating = 10;
");?>
<p>
	You can also use <i>array notation</i> if you like:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book['price'] = 29.99; //you can use array notation as well
"); ?>
<p>
	and store the bean in the database:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$id = R::store( \$book );
"); ?>
<p>
	At this point, the bean will be stored in the database and all
	<b>tables</b> and <b>columns</b> have been created.
	<br>
	The bean will now have an ID, which is
	also returned for your convenience.
</p>
<p class="note">
	RedBeanPHP will build all the necessary structures to store your data.
	However custom
	indexes and constraints have to be added manually (after
	<a href="/fluid_and_frozen" title="Learn about Frozen mode.">freezing</a>
	your web application).
</p>

<p class="note">
	TIP: If you start building an application with RedBeanPHP,
	the easiest way is to start with the add/update form, use
	R::load(bean, id) to either create (0) or update a record (id != 0)
	with a single form! Then use R::find() for the overview (in fluid mode
	it will not throw exceptions if the table does not exist yet). You can
	also use a special install url to prepare the database or take a look
	at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/benmajor/RedSeed">RedSeed</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="conventions">Conventions</h2>
<p>
	You can dispense any type of bean you like, as long
	as the type name consists of <strong>lowercase alphabetical</strong>
	characters:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$page = R::dispense('page'); //valid
	\$page = R::dispense( 'Page' ); //invalid: uppercase
	\$page = R::dispense( 'cms_page' ); //invalid: _
	\$page = R::dispense( '@#!' ); //invalid
"); ?>
<p>
	However dispense also offers some shortcuts:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$twoBooks = R::dispense( 'book', 2 );
	
	//Return an array with 2 beans
	\$twoBooks = R::dispense( 'book', 2 );
	
	//Always returns an array with
	//\$i beans even if \$i=1
	\$moreBooks = R::dispense( 'book', \$i, TRUE ); 

	list(\$book, \$page) = R::dispenseAll( 'book,page' );
	list(\$book, \$pages) = R::dispenseAll( 'book,page*2' );
"); ?>
<p>
	Properties of beans may contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
	<b>Camelcased</b> properties will automatically convert to <b>snake_case</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book->isSoldOut = TRUE; //is_sold_out
	\$book->hasISBNCode = TRUE; //has_isbn_code
"); ?>

<p>
	Do not use field names ending with <b>_id</b>, these are reserved for
	bean relations. <a href="https://www.redbeanphp.com/many_to_one">Learn more...</a>
	Other restrictions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>primary key need to be &quot;id&quot;</li>
	<li>do not name a field &quot;field&quot; if a field &quot;field_id&quot; exist (because of a bean relation)</li>
	<li>do not name a field &quot;field_id&quot; if it's not a foreign key</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="load">Retrieve</h2>
<p>
	To load a bean, simply pass the <b>type</b>
	and <b>ID</b> of the bean you're looking for:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book = R::load( 'book', \$id ); //reloads our book
"); ?>
<p>
	If the bean does not exist an <b>empty</b> bean with ID <b>0</b>
	will be returned.
</p>

<p class="note" id="stringifyFetches">
	By default RedBeanPHP returns only strings, to change this use:
	<b>R::getDatabaseAdapter()-&gt;getDatabase()-&gt;stringifyFetches( FALSE );</b>
	<br>
	For MySQL you also need:	
	<br>
	<b>R::getDatabaseAdapter()-&gt;getDatabase()-&gt;getPDO()-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, FALSE);</b>
</p>

<p class="note" id="lock">
<b>Locking</b> (version 5+)<br>
If you want to lock a bean while loading it, so nobody can change the record associated with your bean until your transaction completes use 
<b>R::loadForUpdate()</b> (version 5+).
<br><br>
It's also possible to attach other kinds of <b>SQL snippets</b> along with the loading function, for instance to
make use of the <i>lock-in-shared-mode</i> feature of a database, you can attach a snippet like this:
<br><br>
<b>R::load('bean', 1, 'LOCK IN SHARED MODE');</b>
<br><br>
	
You can also use SQL snippets like <b>' for update '</b>
with operations like R::find() and R::batch(). Before invoking these commands
just set the SQL snippet you wish to use:<br>
<br>
<b>R::getWriter()-&gt;setSQLSelectSnippet( ... );</b>
</p>

<p class="note" id="loadexception">
<b>Load Exceptions</b> (version 5+)
<br>
If a bean does not exist, <b>R::load()</b> and <b>R::loadForUpdate()</b> will return <b>an empty bean</b>.
<br><br>
If there is an error because of a missing table or column, both methods will return an empty bean in <b>fluid</b> mode
and throw an exception in <b>frozen</b> mode.
<br><br>
If something else happens (lock timeout for instance) both methods will <i>always</i> throw an exception, even in fluid mode*.
<br><br>
*except for SQLite, because in fluid mode it's too difficult to separate error types.
</p>


<h2 id="store">Update</h2>
<p>
	To update a bean in the database, <b>add</b> or <b>change</b>
	properties:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book->title = 'Learn to fly';
	\$book->rating = 'good';
	\$book->published = '2015-02-15';
	R::store( \$book );
"); ?>
<p>
	Note that we added a new property 'published', RedBeanPHP will add a new column
	of type 'date' for this property. Also, it will widen the 'rating' from
	<b>INTEGER</b> to <b>VARCHAR</b> to support text as well as numbers.
</p>
<?php code("
	//Examples of other data types
	\$meeting->when = '1995-12-05'; //Date
	\$photo->created = '1995-12-05 19:00:00'; //Date time
	\$meeting->place = '(1,2)'; //SPATIAL only works in postgreSQL
	\$price->amount = '12.37'; //FIXED POINT NUMERIC - MySQL and Postgres
	\$price->amount = '\$25.00'; //MONEY TYPE - Postgres only
	\$price->json = array( 'message' => 'hello' ); //JSON TYPE 5+
");?>
<p>
	If you want a suitable data type of <b>monetary</b> values, 
	use the 'XX.XX'
	format and you'll get a <b>fixed precision</b> number data field.
	To make use of Postgres <i>special purpose</i>, 
	<i>currency-aware</i> <b>money data type</b>,
	prefix the value with a common currency symbol.
</p>
<p>
	You can use R::isoDate() and R::isoDateTime()
	to generate the current date(time) if you like.
</p>

<p class="note">
	As of RedBeanPHP 4.1 you can also use spatial columns for
	MySQL, <a href="/database#column_functions" title="Learn about RedBeanPHP SQL column functions">learn more</a>.
</p>

<p class="note" id="json">
	As of RedBeanPHP 5 you can now use JSON columns. Arrays in bean properties will be automatically
	converted to JSON strings and the database Query Writer will automatically adjust the column type to JSON
	for you. To enable these features use: <b>R::useJSONFeatures(TRUE);</b> (by default these features are NOT active).
	JSON support should be considered experimental at this stage. JSON support is still very new, check whether your
	DB version supports this.
</p>

<p>
	RedBeanPHP will dynamically add new columns to your database.
	It determines the column type to use by looking at the value you are trying to store.
	For instance, a short text might be stored as a <b>VARCHAR</b> 
	while a large text might be stored as <b>TEXT</b>.
	Similarly, a boolean value will probably get stored as 
	<b>TINYINT</b> but when you put a float in that 
	property the column will probably be changed to <b>FLOAT</b> or <b>DOUBLE</b>
	(depending on your database).<br>
	Some column types behave differently, for instance if you store a valid 
	<i>ISO formatted date</i> (i.e. 2015-01-01) 
	RedBeanPHP builds a <b>DATE</b> column, but this column will not change. In general, RedBeanPHP
	tries to adapt the database to your application. If you're done developing, you can freeze the
	database using the <b>freeze()</b> function. After that, the database schema will no longer change
	(because it is very unlikely you want to store something other than a date in a column you filled with
	perfectly formatted date in the first place).<br>
	Note that RedBeanPHP will never throw away columns or 'shrink' columns (from <b>TEXT</b> to <b>VARCHAR</b>) 
	to
	avoid data loss. RedBeanPHP also only manipulates column types it recognizes, so if you change
	a <b>VARCHAR(255)</b> to a <b>VARCHAR(254)</b> 
	it will leave that column alone, since it no longer <i>recognizes</i> the type.
	This means that if you customize columns, RedBeanPHP leaves them alone from that point on.<br>
	If RedBeanPHP alters the database in a way you don't like, don't worry, you can always tune
	the schema to your liking (just use your database management tool or <b>phpmyadmin</b>), 
	you can even <b>freeze</b> certain tables only.
</p>


<h2 id="delete">Delete</h2>
<p>
	To delete a bean:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::trash( \$book ); //for one bean
	R::trashAll( \$books ); //for multiple beans
"); ?>
<p>
	To delete all beans of a certain type:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::wipe( 'book' ); //burns all the books!
") ?>
<p>
	To destroy the entire database simply invoke the
	nuclear method (be careful!):
</p>
<?php code("
	R::nuke();
");?>


<h2 id="batch">Batch</h2>
<p>
	To load a series of beans use:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books = R::loadAll( 'book', \$ids );
"); ?>
<p>
	This will load all beans of type 'book' that have their id listed in the
	$ids list.
</p>

<h2 id="trashBatch">trashBatch (5.1+)</h2>
<p>
	Similarly, you can use trashBatch to delete an entire collection of beans in one go:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::trashBatch( 'book', \$ids );
"); ?>



<h2 id="reload">Reload</h2>
<p>
	To quickly reload a bean:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$bean = \$bean->fresh();
"); ?>



<h2>Finding Beans</h2>
<p>
	Instead of loading beans, you can also use the find()
	method to search for beans using certain criteria.
	Learn <a href="/finding" title="Learn more about find.">how to query beans</a>  in RedBeanPHP.
</p>


<h1>Finding</h1>
<p>
	If you do not know the
	<b>ID</b> of a bean, you can search for beans using the
	<strong>find</strong> method:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book  = R::find( 'book', ' rating > 4 ');
"); ?>
<p>
	The find() method uses good old <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>.
	No fancy, custom query language &mdash; just plain old SQL.
	<br><br>
	The find operation in this example returns all beans of type <b>book</b>
	having a rating of four stars or more.
</p>

<h2>Find and SQL</h2>
<p>
	The following example demonstrates how to use find() with
	bindings.
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books = R::find( 'book', ' title LIKE ? ', [ 'Learn to%' ] );
"); ?>

<p>
	This find operation will return all beans of type 'book' having
	a title that begins with the phrase: 'Learn to'.
	<br><br>
	If find() has no results it will return an <b>empty array</b>.
</p>

<p class="note">
	There is no need to use mysql_real_escape.
	Always use the bindings.
	<br><br>
	PDO bindings do not work for tables
	(<a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15182910/php-pdo-bind-table-name">see discussion here</a>), however
	if you wish to escape a table name you can use: R::getWriter()->esc( $tableName ).
	<br><br>
	<b style="color:red">Never put user input directly in your query!</b>
</p>

<h2 id="hunt">Hunting Beans (5.1+)</h2>
<p>
	To find and delete beans in one go:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::hunt( 'book',
	' id IN ( '. R::genSlots( \$ids ) .' ) ',
	\$ids );
"); ?>

<p id="hunt52">
	As of RedBeanPHP 5.2:<br>
	returns the number of beans deleted.<br>
	the SQL parameter is optional.
</p>


<h2 id="in-queries">IN-queries</h2>
<p>
	To use a 'SELECT-IN' style query use the R::genSlots function
	to generate the correct number of '?' slots:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$promotions = R::find( 'person',
	' contract_id IN ('.R::genSlots( \$contractIDs ).')',
	\$contractIDs );
"); ?>

<h2>Find One</h2>
<p>
	If you want a single bean instead of an array, use:
</p>

<?php code("
	\$book  = R::findOne( 'book', ' title = ? ', [ 'SQL Dreams' ] );
"); ?>

<p>
	If no beans match the criteria, this function will return
	<b>NULL</b>.
</p>

<p id="explicit_params">
	As of 5.3 you can use explicit parameter binding if you like:
</p>

<?php code("
	\$bean = R::findOne( 'bean', ' property = ? AND property2 = ? AND property3 = ? ', [
    \$value,
    [ \$value2, PDO::PARAM_INT ],
    [ \$value3, PDO::PARAM_STR ]
	]);
");?>


<h2>Find All</h2>
<p>
	Use <b>findAll</b> if you don't want to add any conditions (but you want to
	order or limit... )
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books = R::findAll( 'book' );
	\$books = R::findAll( 'book' , ' ORDER BY title DESC LIMIT 10 ' );
"); ?>
<p>
	If no beans match your criteria, this function returns an <b>empty array</b>.
</p>

<h2>Named slots</h2>
<p>
	All find methods: find, findOne and findAll also accept named slots:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books  = R::find( 'book', ' rating < :rating ', [ ':rating' => 2 ] );
"); ?>

<p class="note">
	Besides querying beans, you can also use
	<a href="/querying" title="Using regular SQL queries in RedBeanPHP">regular SQL queries</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="cursors">Cursors (4.2+)</h2>
<p>
	You can also use find with cursors:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$collection = R::findCollection( 'page', ' ORDER BY content ASC LIMIT 5 ' );
	while( \$item = \$collection->next() ) {
		...
	}
"); ?>
<p>
	Or directly
</p>
<?php code("
	\$cursor = R::getCursor('SELECT * FROM `book` WHERE < :rating LIMIT 5', [ ':rating' => 2 ]);
	while(\$row = \$cursor->getNextItem()){	    
	    ...
	}
	//Reset will execute the query again
	\$cursor->reset();
	\$first = \$cursor->getNextItem();
	
	\$cursor->close();
"); ?>
<p>
	The advantage of using a cursor is that the entire collection will
	not be loaded into memory all at once. This is handy for dealing with
	large bean collections.
</p>

<h2 id="find_like">Find like (4.2+)</h2>
<p>
	To find a bean matching certain <b>criteria</b>, you can use R::findLike().
	The following code returns all flowers that are either yellow OR blue:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::findLike( 'flower', [
		'color' => ['yellow', 'blue']
	], ' ORDER BY color ASC ' );
"); ?>
<p>
	Note that you can append some SQL here along with bindings.
</p>
<p id="beanconditions">As of RedBeanPHP 5.2 you can also use beans as conditions:</p>

<?php code("
	R::findLike( 'page', 
	[ 'book' => [ \$book, \$book2 ] ]
	);
"); ?>

<h2 id="find_create">Find or create (4.2+)</h2>
<p>
	This works like R::findLike() but <b>also creates</b> (and stores) 
	the bean if it does not exist
	yet...
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book = R::findOrCreate( 'book', [
		'title' => 'my book', 
		'price' => 50] );
"); ?>
<h2 id="find_multi">Find Multiple (4.2+)</h2>
<p>
	findMulti() takes a query and turns the result into
	<b>several</b> bean collections having <b>different types</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$beans = R::findMulti( 'book,page', '
		SELECT book.*, page.* FROM book
		INNER JOIN page.book_id = book.id
		WHERE book.category = ?
	', [ \$cat] );
"); ?>
<p>
	The <b>first</b> parameter of this function lists the <b>types</b>
	to load, the <b>second</b> parameter is the <b>query</b>, then
	come the optional query parameter <b>bindings</b>. 
	The result of this operation
	will be something like:
</p>
<?php code("
	array(
		'book' => book beans...
		'page' => page beans...
	)
"); ?>
<p>
	Besides loading various bean types at once from a query,
	this method can also <b>restructure</b> them, for instance to
	<i>'put the pages in the book'</i> use (example of 4th parameter):
</p>
<?php code("
	array(array(
		'a'       => 'book' 
		'b'       => 'page'
		'matcher' =>  function( \$a, \$b ) {
		   return ( \$b->book_id == \$a->id );
		}
		'do'      => function( \$a, \$b ) {
		   \$a->noLoad()->ownPageList[] = \$b;
		}
	));

"); ?>
<p>
	The <b>fourth</b> parameter of findMulti takes an array containing arrays
	like the one above. The array in the example tells findMulti how to <i>restructure</i>
	the pages and the books. 
	First it defines two <b>variables</b> 'a' and 'b'
	it then defines a <b>matcher</b> function, telling RedBeanPHP to execute
	the <b>'do'</b> clause if the book_id of a page matches the id of a page.
	The 'do' clause then puts the page in the pageList of the selected book.
	While you can specify mappings like this, a better idea might be to write
	your own set of <i>mapping functions</i> returning structures like this.
</p>

<h2>Finder::map helper (5.3+)</h2>
<p>
	You can shorten the syntax above using the mapper helper:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$collection = R::findMulti( 'shop,product,price',
	'SELECT shop.*, product.*, price.* FROM shop
	LEFT JOIN product ON product.shop_id = shop.id
	LEFT JOIN price ON price.product_id = product.id', [], [
		Finder::map( 'shop', 'product' ),
		Finder::map( 'product', 'price' ),
	]);
"); ?>

<h2 id="sqn">Short Query Notation (SQN)</h2>
<p>
	If you wish to use a shorter syntax than SQL you can try
	my <a href="http://gabordemooij.com/sqn/" target="_blank">short query notation library</a>.
	Example:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::findMulti('book,book_tag,tag',
	sqn('book<<tag'), [], [Finder::nmMap( 'book', 'tag' )]);
"); ?>


<p class="note" id="beantrimmulti">
	As of RedBeanPHP 5.2 bean type names will be trimmed automatically.
</p>

<p class="note" id="multinull">
	As of RedBeanPHP 5.2 the SQL parameter is optional.
</p>

<h2 id="also">loadJoined() 5.5</h2>
<p>
	As of RedBeanPHP 5.5 you can use Finder::onmap for N-1 relations:	
</p>
<?php code("
	\$all = R::findMulti('country',
	R::genSlots( \$users,
	'SELECT country.* FROM country WHERE id IN ( %s )' ),
	array_column( \$users, 'country_id' ),
	[Finder::onmap('country', \$gebruikers)]
	);
");?>
<p>But you can also use the loadJoined() shortcut:</p>
<?php
code("
	\$users = R::find('user');
	\$users = R::loadJoined( \$users, 'country' );
");?>
	

<h1>Querying</h1>
<p>
	Querying the database <i>manually</i> is also possible with RedBeanPHP.
	You can use the
	<abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> query functions provided by
	<strong>RedBeanPHP</strong>. To execute a query:
</p>


<?php code("
	R::exec( 'UPDATE page SET title=\"test\" WHERE id = 1' );
");?>
<p>
	To get a <b>multidimensional</b> array:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::getAll( 'SELECT * FROM page' );
");?>
<p>
	The result of such a query will be a <b>multidimensional</b> array:
</p>
<?php code("
	Array
	(
	    [0] => Array
	        (
	            [id] => 1
	            [title] => frontpage
	            [text] => hello
	        )
	    ...
	)
");?>
<p>
	Note that you can use <b>parameter bindings</b> as well:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::getAll( 'SELECT * FROM page WHERE title = :title',
		[':title' => 'home']
	);
");?>
<p>
	To fetch a <b>single row</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::getRow( 'SELECT * FROM page WHERE title LIKE ? LIMIT 1',
		[ '%Jazz%' ]
	);
");?>
<p>
	To fetch a <b>single column</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::getCol( 'SELECT title FROM page' );
");?>
<p>
	And finally, a <b>single cell</b>...
</p>
<?php code("
	R::getCell( 'SELECT title FROM page LIMIT 1' );
");?>
<p>
	To get an associative array with a specified key and value column use:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::getAssoc( 'SELECT id, title FROM page' );
");?>
<p>
	In this case, the keys will be the IDs and the values will be the titles.
	<b>getAssocRow</b> will return complete rows.
</p>
<p>
	For dynamic queries use <b>R::getWriter()-&gt;esc()</b> &amp; <b>R::getPDO()-&gt;quote()</b>	
</p>
<?php code("
	\$pdo = R::getPDO();
	\$writer = R::getWriter();
	\$table = 'page';
	\$value = 'unsafe_string';
	\$result = R::getRow('SELECT * FROM '.\$writer->esc(\$table).' WHERE '.\$writer->esc(\$table).'.title = '. \$pdo->quote(\$value).' LIMIT 1' ,[]);
");?>
<p class="note">
	In my examples, I like to use the short array notation.
	<br>
	In PHP &lt; 5.4 you'll have to use the classic array notation:
	<br><br>
	<i>array( 'key' =&gt; 'value' )</i>.
</p>


<h2 id="get_insert_id">Get the insert ID (4.2+)</h2>
<p>
	To get the ID after an insert in MySQL/MariaDB compatible databases use:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::exec( 'INSERT INTO ... ' );
	\$id = R::getInsertID();
"); ?>
<h2 id="convert">Converting records to beans</h2>
<p>
	You can convert rows to beans using the convertToBeans() function:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$sql = 'SELECT author.* FROM author
		JOIN club WHERE club.id = 7 ';
	\$rows = R::getAll( \$sql );
	\$authors = R::convertToBeans( 'author', \$rows );
");?>

<p class="note">
	As of version 4.3.2 you can also use: <b>R::convertToBean</b>, 
	without the <b>s</b>, for <b>single</b> rows.
</p>

<h2 id="find_from_sql">Find from SQL (5.6+)</h2>
<p>
	As of version 5.6, you can create beans from an SQL in one go,
	using the additional Facade convenience method findFromSQL.<br>
	Usage (Postgres dialect):
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books = R::findFromSQL('book',\"
		SELECT *, count(*) OVER() AS total FROM book WHERE
	 	genre = ? ORDER BY title ASC OFFSET {\$from} LIMIT {\$to} 
	\", [ \$bindings ],  [ 'total' ]);
	\$book  = reset(\$books);
	\$total = \$book->info('total');
"); ?>
<p>
	This style of querying might be handy for finding beans along
	with pagination data to paginate results properly (in this case
	the OVER-clause only works with Postgres). You can use the info()
	method on a bean to access the <a href="https://redbeanphp.com/index.php?p=/meta_data#masks">meta data</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
	<b>Remember:</b>
	<br>
	There is no need to use <b>mysql_real_escape</b> as long as you use parameter binding.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Besides querying you can also use other database functionality (like transactions) in RedBeanPHP.
	Learn more about
	<a href="/database" title="Database functions in RedBeanPHP">database functions</a>.
</p>

<h1>Extended SQL</h1>

<p>
        As of RedBeanPHP 5.5 you can use some SQL extensions besides @joined,
	and you can use those extensions with almost any RedBeanPHP function
	that accepts an SQL snippet.
</p>

<h2>@joined</h2>
<p>
	Use @joined to access parent beans directly in SQL:
</p>
<?php code("
         \$people = R::find( 'person', 
         ' @joined.movement.name = ? ',
         ['romanticism']);
");?>

<h2>@own</h2>
<p>
	Use @own to access own-lists in SQL:
</p>
<?php code("
         \$movements = R::find( 'movement',
         ' @own.author.name LIKE ? ', 
         [ 'A%' ]);
");?>

<h2>@shared</h2>
<p>
	Use @own to access own-lists in SQL:
</p>
<?php code("
        \$people = R::find( 'person', ' @shared.tag.title = ? ', ['writer']);
");?>

<h2>Chaining</h2>
<p>
      SQL-extensions also work with CTEs (trees) and you can chain them.
</p>
<?php code("
       \$pages = R::children( \$website, 
       ' @joined.author.name = ? AND 
         @own.chart.file = ? AND 
         @joined.author.shared.role.label = ? ',
         ['John', 'report.jpg', 'CEO']
       );
"); ?>

<p>
	In the tree-query above we use multiple SQL-extensions together and
	we also chain them, @joined.author.shared.role.label will access the
	author parent beans and then check the label associated with its shared role.
	You can make it as complex as you wish. Under the hood, RedBeanPHP translates
	these @-lists to JOINS.
</p>

<h2>Aliasing in SQL-extensions</h2>
<p>
	Use aliases in SQL-extensions as follows:
</p>
<?php code("
         \$books = R::find('book', 
         ' @joined.person[as:author].firstname = ? ',
         ['Bob']);
"); ?>
<p>
	This will find any book written by Bob, checking the name using
	the author-property of the bean instead of the person property. You can also
	use aliases for own-lists:
</p>
<?php code("
         \$authors = R::find( 'person',
         ' @own.book[alias:author].title LIKE ? ',
         [ '%Study%' ]);
"); ?>
<p>
	Separate multiple aliases with a slash:
</p>
<?php code("
         \$books = R::find( 'book',
         ' @joined.person[as:author/coauthor].firstname = ?',
         [ 'Bob' ] );
");?>
<p>
	Note that the word in front of the colon (as:) is only there for yourself
	as a reminder, RedBeanPHP figures out how to use the alias depending on the
	type of list you access. Of course you can chain aliased items as well:
</p>
<?php code("
         \$texts = R::find('text', 
         ' @joined.book[as:magazine/source/book].joined.person[as:author/coauthor].firstname = ? ',
        ['Albert']);
"); ?>

<h2>Vias in Extensions</h2>
<p>
	To treat an intermediate bean type or two complimentary N-1 relations as
	as a N-M relation in SQL, you can use the via-operator as well:
</p>
<?php code("
         \$companies = R::find('company', 
         ' @joined.work.shared.employee[via:participant].name LIKE ? ',
         ['a']);

"); ?>
<p>
	These features can also be used in $books = $author-&gt;withCondition( SQL ) - context.
</p>

<h1>Data Tools</h1>
<p>
	In RedBeanPHP version 5, some additional functions have been added to increase your
	productivity even more. These are convience functions building upon the solid
	foundation of RedBeanPHP, allowing you to quickly perform a lot of work with just
	a single command.
</p>
<h2 id="look">Look (5+)</h2>
<p>
	To quickly generate template snippets that rely on database data you can use Look:
</p>
<?php code("
	 R::look(
		'SELECT * FROM color 
		 WHERE value != ? 
                 ORDER BY value ASC',
		[ 'green' ],
		[ 'value', 'name' ],
		'<option value=\"%s\">%s</option>', 'strtoupper', \"\\n\"
	);
");?>
<p>
	Given the colors red, green and blue, this code will return an HTML snippet
	for a select-list with the colors RED and BLUE in uppercase.
</p>

<h2 id="matchup">MatchUp (5+)</h2>
<p>
	MatchUp is a powerful productivity boosting method that can replace simple control
	scripts with a single RedBeanPHP command. Typically, matchUp() is used to
	replace login scripts, token generation scripts and password reset scripts.
	The MatchUp method takes a bean type, an SQL query snippet (starting at the WHERE clause),
	SQL bindings, a pair of task arrays and a bean reference.<br>
	If the first 3 parameters match a bean, the first task list will be considered,
	otherwise the second one will be considered. On consideration, each task list,
	an array of keys and values will be executed. Every key in the task list should
	correspond to a bean property while every value can either be an expression to
	be evaluated or a closure (PHP 5.3+). After applying the task list to the bean
	it will be stored. If no bean has been found, a new bean will be dispensed.
	This method will return TRUE if the bean was found and FALSE if not AND
	there was a NOT-FOUND task list. If no bean was found AND there was also
	no second task list, NULL will be returned. Here is an example of how we could
	use MatchUp for a typical password-reset script:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$newpass = '1234';
	\$didResetPass = R::matchUp(
		'account',
		' token = ? AND tokentime > ? ',
		[ [ \$token , \PDO::PARAM_STR ], time()-100 ],
		[
			'pass' => \$newpass,
			'token' => ''
		],
		NULL,
		\$account );
");?>

<p class="note">
I recommend to use the PARAM_STR for tokens to avoid casting related security issues.
</p>

<h2 id="csv">CSV Queries (5+)</h2>
<p>
	To quickly generate a CSV file with a single RedBeanPHP command use R::csv()
	like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::csv( '
		SELECT city,popularity 
		FROM scores 
		WHERE score > ?
	', [5], ['CITY','SCORE'] );

"); ?>

<h2 id="diff">Diff (5+)</h2>
<p>
	To quickly get the difference between two beans (or arrays of beans) and their relations use R::diff().
	For instance, let's create a book with some pages:
</p>
<?php code("
		list(\$book,\$pages) = R::dispenseAll('book,page*2');
		\$book->title = 'Old Book';
		\$book->price = 999;
		\$book->ownPageList = \$pages;
		\$pages[0]->text = 'abc';
		\$pages[1]->text = 'def';
		R::store(\$book);
");?>
<p>
Now we change the book:
</p>
<?php code("
		\$book->title = 'new Book';
		\$page = end(\$book->ownPageList);
		\$page->text = 'new';
");?>
<p>
We can now compare both books using:
</p>
<?php code("
		\$oldBook = \$book->fresh();
		\$oldBook->ownPageList;
		\$diff = R::diff(\$oldBook, \$book);
"); ?>
<p>
If we print_r() that variable we'll see:
</p>
<kbd>
Array
(
    [book.1.title] => Array
        (
            [0] => Old Book
            [1] => new Book
        )

    [book.1.ownPage.2.text] => Array
        (
            [0] => def
            [1] => new
        )

)
</kbd>
<p>
	The 3rd parameter can be used to set a filter, all bean types in the filter will
	be omitted. To format the keys set a format in the 4th parameter, the default value
	(giving us this result) is: '%s.%s.%s'. This is printf-like format.
</p>


<h2>How to use queries</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes using a plain query is more efficient than using beans.
	For instance, consider the following example:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books = R::findAll( 'book' );
	foreach( \$books as \$book ) {
		echo \$book->title;
		echo \$book->author->name;
		foreach( \$book->sharedCategoryList as \$cat ) {
			echo \$cat->name;
		}
	}
"); ?>
<p>
	Using a plain query this task could be accomplished far more
	efficiently:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books = R::getAll( 'SELECT 
	book.title AS title, 
	author.name AS author, 
	GROUP_CONCAT(category.name) AS categories FROM book
	JOIN author ON author.id = book.author_id
	LEFT JOIN book_category ON book_category.book_id = book.id
	LEFT JOIN category ON book_category.category_id = category.id 
	GROUP BY book.id
	' );
	foreach( \$books as \$book ) {
		echo \$book['title'];
		echo \$book['author'];
		echo \$book['categories'];
	}
"); ?>
<p>
	One of the biggest mistakes people make with <b>ORM</b> tools is to
	try to accomplish <i>everything</i> with objects (or beans). They forget
	SQL is a very powerful tool as well. Use <b>SQL</b> if you are merely
	interested in generating reports or lists.
</p>

<h1>Database</h1>
<p>
	This chapter discusses general database functionality of RedBeanPHP.
</p>

<h2>Server version (5.6+)</h2>
<p id="server_version">
	Due to slight difference appearing between MySQL and MariaDB it might sometimes by handy
	to obtain the database server version string. You can use R::getDatabaseServerVersion() for this.
</p>
<?php code("
	\$version = R::getDatabaseServerVersion();
"); ?>
	
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
	To get all the columns of table '<b>book</b>':
</p>
<?php code("
	\$fields = R::inspect( 'book' );
"); ?>
<p>
	To get all tables:
</p>
<?php
code("
	\$listOfTables = R::inspect();
");
?>


<h2>Multiple databases</h2>
<p>
	There are two important methods to keep in mind when working with multiple <b>databases</b>:
	<b>addDatabase()</b> and <b>selectDatabase()</b>.
	<br>
	To add a new database connection use R::addDatabase() like this:
</p>
<?php
code("
	R::addDatabase( 'DB1', 'sqlite:/tmp/d1.db', 'usr', 'pss', \$frozen );
");
?>
<p>
	To select a database, use the key you have previously specified:
</p>
<?php
code("
	R::selectDatabase( 'DB1' );
");
?>
<p>
	If you used <b>R::setup()</b> to connect to your database you can switch back to this database
	using:
</p>
<?php
code("
	R::selectDatabase( 'default' );
");
?>


<h2>Transactions</h2>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP offers three simple methods to use database <b>transactions</b>: begin(), commit() and rollback().
	Usage:
</p>
<?php

echo code("
	R::begin();
	try{
		R::store( \$page );
		R::commit();
	}
	catch( Exception \$e ) {
		R::rollback();
	}
");
?>
<p>
	Because RedBeanPHP throws <b>exceptions</b>, you can catch
	the exceptions thrown by methods like R::store(), R::trash(), or one of your 'fuse' methods,
	and perform a rollback(). The rollback() will completely undo
	all the pending database changes.
</p>

<h2>Transaction closure</h2>
<p>
	You can also use this variation:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::transaction( function() {
		..store some beans..
	} );
");?>
<p>
	The transaction() method supports nested transactions.
</p>
<p class="note">
	Note about auto-commits:
	<br>Many databases automatically commit after changing schemas,
	so make sure you test your transactions after <b>R::freeze(true);</b> !
</p>

<h2 id="column_functions">Column Functions (version 4.1+)</h2>
<p>
	As of RedBeanPHP 4.1 you can <i>bind</i> an <b>SQL function</b> to a column.
	This is useful for wrapping values when reading from / writing to
	the database. <br>
	For instance, to use <i>MySQL spatial
	data types</i> you need to prepare the columns like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::bindFunc( 'read', 'location.point', 'asText' );
	R::bindFunc( 'write', 'location.point', 'GeomFromText' );

	\$location = R::dispense( 'location' );
	\$location->point = 'POINT(14 6)';

	//inserts using GeomFromText() function
	R::store( \$location );

	//to unbind a function, pass NULL:
	R::bindFunc( 'read', 'location.point', NULL );
"); ?>
<p>
	While this method has been implemented to support MySQL spatial
	data types, you can use it for other purposes as well.<br>
	For instance, you can <i>encode</i> your own data types,
	create an <b>encryption</b> function or a <b>UUID</b> function.
</p>


<p class="note">
	As you have seen in the previous chapters RedBeanPHP will keep changing the schema to fit your needs,
	this is called '<b>fluid mode</b>'.
	While this is great for development, you don't want this to happen on your
	production server. Learn how to
	<a href="/fluid_and_frozen" title="Freeze the database.">freeze</a> your database for deployment.
</p>

<h2 id="query_counter">Query counter (4.2+)</h2>
<p>
	To count get number of queries processed use:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::resetQueryCount(); //reset counter
	R::getQueryCount(); //get number of queries processed by adapter
");?>

<h2 id="logging">Logging (4.2+)</h2>
<p>
	Logging has always been possible with RedBeanPHP, however from 4.2 on there
	is an easier way to setup logging:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::startLogging(); //start logging
	\$logs = R::getLogs(); //obtain logs
");?>

<h2 id="partialBeans">Partial Beans (5+)</h2>
<?php code("
	R::usePartialBeans( TRUE );
");?>


<p>
Toggles 'partial bean mode'. If this mode has been
selected the repository will only update the fields of a bean that
have been changed rather than the entire bean.
This method will return the previous mode (TRUE/FALSE).
</p>

<p class="note" id="partialbeansetup">
In RedBeanPHP 5.2+ you can also set the 4th parameter of setup() to TRUE
to enable partial beans.
</p>

<h1>Fluid and Frozen</h1>


<p>
	RedBeanPHP has two modes, <b>fluid</b> and <b>frozen</b>.
	<br>
	As you have seen in the previous chapters,
	RedBeanPHP will keep changing the schema to fit your needs,
	this is what we call '<b>fluid mode</b>'.
	<br>
	While this is great for development you don't want this to happen on your
	production server. That's why you need to <b>freeze</b> the schema before
	you deploy your application. To freeze your app, put <b>R::freeze( TRUE )</b>
	at the beginning of your script, like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	require 'rb.php';
	R::setup();
	R::freeze( TRUE );
	...your code...
"); ?>
<p>
	After freezing the schema, open your database client and inspect the schema
	RedBeanPHP has created for you. You can now refine it where necessary, i.e.
	add some indexes, change some columns, add or change constraints and more.
</p>
<p class="note">
	Always review the schema generated by RedBeanPHP and allow yourself some
	time to refine it.
	<br>
	Do not change the table or column names though, these are part of the
	RedBeanPHP conventions. Instead I recommend to inspect and refine
	column types ( maybe a bit too wide ? ), indexes and foreign key constraint settings.
</p>



<h2>Partial freezing (Chill mode)</h2>
<p>
	It's also possible to only lock the schemas of several types of beans, for instance
	to lock the schemas of bean types 'book', 'page' and 'book_page' use:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::freeze( ['book','page','book_page'] );
"); ?>
<p>
	This makes RedBeanPHP operate in fluid mode, but those tables will not get
	modified. To reset, pass an empty array.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Learn how to use the
	<a href="/debugging" title="Learn how to use the debugging tools of RedBeanPHP">debugging tools</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="hybrid">Hybrid Mode (5.4+)</h2>
<p>
	R::store() and R::storeAll() both take a second parameter: $unfreezeIfNeeded.
	If set to TRUE in frozen mode, RedBeanPHP will
	automatically temporarily switch to fluid mode to attempt to store the
	bean in case of an SQLException.
</p>


<h1>Debugging</h1>
<p>
	The debug() method will reveal all queries being executed by RedBeanPHP:
</p>
<?php code("
	//turns debugging ON (recommended way)
	R::fancyDebug( TRUE );

	//turns debugging ON (classic)
	R::debug( TRUE );

	//turns debugging OFF
	R::debug( FALSE );
"); ?>
<p>
	The queries will be printed on the screen.
	The output of the debugging function looks like this:
</p>
<kbd>

INSERT INTO &quot;event&quot; ( id, &quot;name&quot; ) VALUES<br>
			( NULL,  ?  )<br>
Array<br><br>
(<br>
    [0] =&gt; party<br>
)<br>
<br>
</kbd>


<p>
	You can also log the queries:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::debug( TRUE, 1 ); //select mode 1 to suppress screen output
"); ?>
<p>
	To access the logs:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$logs = R::getDatabaseAdapter()
			->getDatabase()
			->getLogger();

	print_r( \$logs->grep( 'SELECT' ) );
"); ?>
<p>
	Use the grep() method to search the logs.
</p>

<h2 id="debugger2">Query parameters</h2>
<p>
	By default, the debugger prints the queries
	and parameters in separate sections. Sometimes you might
	prefer to see what the actual query would look like if the
	parameters had been filled in.
	RedBeanPHP 4.1+ offers two new debugger modes to facilitate
	this:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::debug( TRUE, 2 ); //select MODE 2 to see parameters filled in
	R::fancyDebug();   //since 4.2
");?>
<p>Outputs the query above like this:</p>
<kbd>

INSERT INTO &quot;event&quot; ( id, &quot;name&quot; ) VALUES<br>
			( NULL,  &quot;party&quot;  )<br>
</kbd>
<p>
	Mode 2 also writes to the logs, if you want to suppress
	screen output, select mode 3.
</p>

<p>
	In 'fancy' mode schema altering queries are highlighted as well as bound
        parameters. Parameter bindings are also included in the SQL instead of in a separate
        list. If a parameter value is too long, fancy debug will only show the first part so
        your query remains readable. Also, fancy debug works with HTML colors as well, in case
        you like to debug with a browser instead of a command line.
</p>

<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>
	Under the hood, all debugging functionality makes use of the logger
	classes. There are two logger classes available in RedBeanPHP:
	the Default Logger and the Debugger Logger (4.1+). Besides using the
	convenience methods listed here you can create your own logger
	instance and attach it to some object:
</p>
<?php
code("
	\$myLogger = new \RedBeanPHP\Logger\RDefault;
	\$database->setLogger(\$myLogger);
");
?>

<p class="note">
	As of version <b>4.3.2</b> R::fancyDebug( TRUE ); is the recommended
	way to debug.
</p>

<h2 id="dump">Inspecting Beans</h2>
<p>
	The easiest way to inspect a bean is to just echo it.
</p>
<?php
code("
	echo \$bean;
");
?>
<p>
	If you have a list of beans, an array, you can use good old
	print_r of course, but print_r will also print useless details.
	To get a shorter and more descriptive summary of a bean or an
	array of beans you can use the dump() function:
</p>
<?php code("
	print_r( R::dump( \$myBeans ) );
	print_r( R::dump( \$singleBean ) );
"); ?>
<p>
	The output looks like this:
</p>
<kbd>
[1] =&gt; {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;party&quot;}
</kbd>
<p>
	An even shorter syntax:
</p>
<?php code("
	dmp( \$myBean );
");?>
<p>
	The dmp() function is a global function for your convenience.
</p>



<h2 id="error_handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>
	Error handling is different in fluid and frozen mode. In fluid mode
	SQL errors caused by missing columns or tables will be suppressed but
	other errors (syntax) will throw <b>RedException\SQL</b> exceptions.
</p>
<p class="note">
	SQLite and some plugin drivers do not provide meaningful <b>SQLSTATE</b> codes, therefore
	under these drivers fluid mode will suppress all errors.
</p>

<h2 id="test_connection">Testing the connection</h2>
<p>
	In RedBeanPHP 4.1+ you can test the connection using a special test
	function. This function will refrain from throwing exceptions and
	simply return TRUE if the connection has been established and
	FALSE otherwise:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$isConnected = R::testConnection();
") ?>
<p>
	Besides debugging, this function is handy for installers and setup scripts
	of web applications to determine whether database credentials have been
	entered correctly.

</p>




<category>Relations</category>

<h1>One-to-many</h1>
<p>
	In a <b>one-to-many</b> relation,
	one bean has a list of other beans but all those beans
	cannot belong to another bean at the same time.
	For instance, let's create a shop:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$shop = R::dispense( 'shop' );
	\$shop->name = 'Antiques';
"); ?>
<p>
	To add products to the shop, add
	beans to the <b>ownProductList</b> property, like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$vase = R::dispense( 'product' );
	\$vase->price = 25;
	\$shop->ownProductList[] = \$vase
	R::store( \$shop );
"); ?>
<p>
	Each product in the <b>ownProductList</b>
	belongs to shop and <i>cannot</i> belong to another shop.
	<br><br>
	Note that the name of the list <b>has to match the type of beans it contains</b>.
	So, the 'ownProductList' contains beans of type 'product', a pageList contains pages,
	an 'ownCarList' contains 'cars' and so on. This convention is used to create the database mapping, in case of the
	shop, every product record will get a <b>'shop_id'</b> field.
	<br><br>
	When you access an own-list, RedBeanPHP will query the related beans
	and populate the array, this is called <i>lazy loading</i>. So, to load the list:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$shop = R::load( 'shop', \$id );
	\$first = reset( \$shop->ownProductList ); //gets first product
	\$last = end( \$shop->ownProductList ); //gets last product
	foreach( \$shop->ownProductList as \$product ) {...} //iterate
"); ?>
<p>
	To remove the products from the shop:
</p>
<?php code("
	//remove one product by its ID
	unset( \$store->ownProductList[\$id] );

	//remove all
	\$store->ownProductList = array();
	R::store( \$shop );
"); ?>

<p>
	To replace the current list of products:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$store->ownProductList = [ \$vase, \$lamp ];
"); ?>

<p class="note">
        Be careful with __toString methods in beans, RedBeanPHP uses the string representation of a bean to determine
	whether it should be added or removed from the list.
</p>

<h2 id="exclusive-one-to-many">Exclusive mode</h2>
<p>
	Note that those products continue to <i>exist</i> in the database, they are just <b>unrelated</b>, don't want that ?
	Then open the <b>own-list</b> in <b>exclusive mode</b>, using
	the <b>x-own-list</b> like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$shop->xownProductList = array();
	R::store( \$shop );
");?>
<p>
	Emptying the list now will cause the vases to be gone too.
	In <i>exclusive mode</i> the beans in the list are considered to be dependent on their owner. If they
	are removed from the list, they are deleted as well (i.e. they <b>depend</b> exclusively on their owner).
	<br><br>
	When using the <b>x-own-list</b> from the <b>start</b>, if you <b>delete</b> the shop,
	its products will be <b>deleted</b> as well.
</p>
<p class="note">
	This happens because the first time
	you access an own-list, a foreign key will be created for the owned bean, one that will
	<b>CASCADE ON DELETE</b> for an x-own-list and one that will <b>SET-TO-NULL</b> otherwise.
	Once the foreign key is in place, it will not be modified by RedBeanPHP anymore.

	However you can
	always change the constraint manually using your database client.
</p>

<h2>Other end of the one-to-many</h2>
<p>
	The other end of the one-to-many relation is
	the many-to-one relation.
	Learn more about the
	<a href="/many_to_one" title="Many-to-one.">many-to-one relation</a>.
</p>



<h1>Many-to-one</h1>
<p>
	Now let's look at this relation from the perspective of a product.
	A product belongs to a shop, so you can access the shop like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$shop = \$product->shop;
"); ?>
<p>
	This is called the <b>'parent bean'</b>.
	<br>
	The shop is considered the parent of
	the product. It <b>owns</b> the product.
</p>
<h2 id="exists">Exists (5+)</h2>
<p>
	To check if a related bean exists:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$product->exists('shop');
"); ?>
<p>
	This function will return TRUE if a shop has been
	associated with the product and FALSE otherwise.
</p>
<h2>Setting a parent bean</h2>
<p>
	To set a parent bean:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$product->shop = \$someShop;
	R::store( \$product );
");?>
<p>
	Note that, when you <b>set</b> a new shop the property
	shop_id <b>still</b> points to the old shop (or is still NULL if there
	was no previous shop). This field gets updated <b>after</b> the bean
	has been saved. So, the shop_id and shop fields are not always in sync.
</p>
<?php code("
	\$product->shop = \$newShop;
	echo \$product->shop_id; //still old value
	R::store( \$product );
	echo \$product->shop_id; //has been updated!
");?>
<p>
	Another way to update the shop is to simply set the new id,
	once again, shop_id and shop will be out-of-sync until
	the next R::store().
</p>
<?php code("
	\$oldShop = \$product->shop;
	\$product->shop_id = \$newID;
	echo \$product->shop->id; //old id
	R::store( \$product );
	echo \$product->shop->id; //new id
");?>
<p>
	However if we change the id <b>before</b>
	we load the shop, the new shop <b>will be loaded</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$product->shop_id = \$newID;
	echo \$product->shop->id; //old id
	R::store( \$product );
	echo \$product->shop->id; //new id
");?>
<p>
	This may seem a bit weird but it's actually quite logical.
	When <b>accessing</b> the <b>parent bean</b>, RedBeanPHP
	simply looks at the value of shop_id and loads the shop
	identified by <b>that</b> id.
</p>
<p class="note">
	As of RedBeanPHP 4.3.4 the latter behavior has been resolved.
	Changing the _id property after loading will also sync the
	loaded bean.
</p>



<h2>Removing the parent</h2>
<p>
	To remove the shop from our product in the example above, simply
	assign the value <b>NULL</b> to the property 'shop':
</p>
<?php code("
	\$product->shop = NULL; //removes product from shop
"); ?>

<p>
	Besides one-to-many, RedBeanPHP has a special version of this
	relation: the one-to-X also known as the one-to-fixed relation.
	Read more about the
	<a href="/one_to_fixed" title="One-to-fixed">One-to-fixed relation</a>.
</p>




<h1>Aliases</h1>
<p>
	Sometimes you want to refer to a bean using a different name.
	For instance,
	when you have a course referring to a teacher and a student, both of which are people.
	In this case you can use <b>fetchAs</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$c = R::dispense( 'course' );

	//At assignment time, no difference...
	\$c->teacher = R::dispense( 'person' );
	\$c->student = R::dispense( 'person' );

	\$id = R::store( \$c );
	\$c = R::load( 'course', \$id );

	//when accessing the aliased properties,
	//tell RedBeanPHP how to find the bean:
	\$teacher = \$c->fetchAs( 'person' )->teacher;
"); ?>


<p>
	fetchAs tells RedBeanPHP the <b>ID</b> has to be associated with a
	different <i>type</i> (in this case 'person' instead of 'teacher' or 'student').
	This also works the other way:
</p>
<?php code("
	//returns all courses for this person
	//where he/she is the teacher.
	\$person->alias( 'teacher' )->ownCourseList;
"); ?>

<p>
	From a relational point of view, we have <b>exactly</b> two people
	for every row (although one or both can be NULL of course). This is why
	we call these 'aliases' <b>one-to-X</b> relations
	(or <b>one-to-fixed</b> relations), where <i>X</i> is a fixed number.
	<br>
	You can use as many of these 'aliases' as you like.
</p>

<p class="note" id="autoresolve">
	As of 4.2 RedBeanPHP supports automatic resolve, this means you can use
	$course-&gt;teacher <b>without</b> fetchAs. Autoresolve also works with
	R::dup() and R::export(). To use automatic resolvement of aliased parent beans,
	use R::setAutoResolve( TRUE ).
</p>

<p class="note" id="global_aliases">
	As of 4.2 you can use global aliases. Instead of specifying the alias
	with fetchAs each time you can specify the alias using R::aliases( ...aliases... );
</p>


<p>
	Also learn about
	<a href="/many_to_many" title="Many-to-many relations">Many-to-many relations</a>.
</p>



<h1>Many-to-many</h1>
<p>
	A <b>shared list</b> contains beans that may be associated with more than just one
	other bean (<b>many-to-many relation</b>). Tags are a common example:
</p>
<?php code("
	list(\$vase, \$lamp) = R::dispense('product', 2);

	\$tag = R::dispense( 'tag' );
	\$tag->name = 'Art Deco';

	//creates product_tag table!
	\$vase->sharedTagList[] = \$tag;
	\$lamp->sharedTagList[] = \$tag;
	R::storeAll( [\$vase, \$lamp] );
"); ?>
<p>
	In this example, a product can have multiple tags
	and every tag in the list can be associated with other products as well.
	The latter was <i>not</i> possible in the one-to-many relation.
	<br><br>
	Like the <b>own-list</b> the name of the <b>shared-list</b> has to
	<b>match the type</b> of beans it contains.
	In the database, these assocations will be stored using
	a link table called 'product_tag'.
</p>
<p class="note">
	This link table is cleaned up automatically, if you break the association
	between two beans in a shared list the link record is removed as well.
	Also note that a shared list cannot have <b>aliases</b> and always applies
	a UNIQUE constraint (you cannot have duplicate links). In some situations
	this means you have to use a slighly different approach; the <a href="/other_relations#aggr" title="Aggregations">N11N relation</a>.
</p>


<h2>Via relations</h2>
<p>
	Using the <b>via()</b> method,
	you can treat normal beans as if they were
	<b>N-M</b> relations:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$participant->project = \$project;
	\$participant->employee = \$lisa;
	\$participant->role = 'developer';
	R::store( \$participant );

	//get all associated employees via the participants
	//(includes \$lisa!)
	\$employees = \$project
		->via( 'participant' )
		->sharedEmployeeList;
"); ?>
<p>
	Remember that, since unrelated link beans are removed automatically,
	emptying a shared list (even using via) causes the link beans to be removed!
	However, you can always <i>nullify</i> the relations manually of course.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Via is <b>sticky</b>, once you tell RedBeanPHP to fetch a type of bean via another
	bean it will remember this for the rest of the program. So, once you told RedBeanPHP:
	$project-&gt;via('participant')-&gt;sharedEmployee it will always load employees using
	the participant table as a link table, even if you later say: $project-&gt;sharedEmployee.
	Also note that via() reloads the list.
</p>



<h2 id="self_referential_many_to_many">Self referential N-M</h2>
<p>
	You can have a shared list containing beans of the same type
	as the owner of the list:
</p>
<?php
code("
	\$friends = \$friend->sharedFriend;
");
?><p>
	In this case RedBeanPHP will operate in a special self-referential many-to-many relationship mode.
	It will not only retrieve all friends of $friend, but also all other friends that are associated with
	$friend.
</p>

<p class="note">
	You can use two complimentary one-to-many relations as one many-to-many relation.
	This is called <a href="/other_relations#aggr" title="Learn more about aggregation">an aggregation or N11N-relation</a>.
</p>



<h1>Using SQL Snippets</h1>
<p>
	You can modify the contents of an own-list and a shared-list using additional
	<b>SQL snippets</b>. Use <b>with()</b> to order or limit the list and
	<b>withCondition</b> to add additional filtering.
</p>
<?php code("
	\$pages = \$book
		->with( ' ORDER BY pagenum ASC ' )
		->ownPageList;

	\$vases = \$shop
		->withCondition(' category = ? ', ['vase'] )
		->ownProductList;

	//combine condition and order
	\$vases = \$shop
		->withCondition(' category = ? ORDER BY price ASC ', ['vase'] )
		->ownProductList;

	\$employees = \$project
		->withCondition(' priority > 40 ')
		->sharedEmployeeList;

	//Special case, filter on linking records...
	\$employees = \$project
		->withCondition(' employee_project.assigned < ? ', [ \$date ])
		->sharedEmployeeList;

"); ?>
<p>
	Note the last case in this example. Here we use a column from the link table
	to filter the rows. This technique allows you to filter on relational qualifications like
	the duration of the assignment to the project.
</p>
<p class="note">
	You cannot combine <b>with()</b> and <b>withCondition()</b>. Instead, you
	can append additional clauses like in the third example.
</p>

<p class="note">
	<b>Important note about AND/OR statements in snippets</b>. If you plan to use AND/OR
	statements in your conditions, please remember your snippet is <i>integrated</i>
	into a larger query. For the best results, it is recommended that you put your
	AND/OR snippets between parenthesis like this:
	<br>
	<br>
	...-&gt;withCondition(' <b>(</b> deleted IS NULL OR deleted = 0 <b>)</b> ')...
</p>


<h2 id="via-and-sql">Via and SQL</h2>
<p>
	Via can be used with SQL snippets as well:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$designers = \$project
		->withCondition( ' participant.role = ? ', ['designer'] )
		->via( 'participant' )
		->sharedEmployeeList;
"); ?>




<p class="note">
	Both with() and
	withCondition() cause the list to reload, however if the SQL snippet hasn't changed
	and the writer cache is active (default) then no query will be send
	to the database.
</p>

<h2>Reloading a list</h2>
<p>
	To reload a list without an SQL snippet use the <b>all()</b> method or unset it:
</p>

<?php code("
	\$shop->all()->xownProductList;
	unset( \$shop->xownProductList ); //will be reloaded next time.
"); ?>



<h2 id="joins">Joins (version 4.1+)</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes you want to sort or filter an own-list based on some
	other property in <b>another bean</b>. You can use the <b>@joined</b>
	keyword to select such a property and RedBeanPHP will automatically
	join-in this field:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$books = \$author
		->withCondition(' 
			@joined.info.title LIKE ? 
			AND @joined.category.title = ? 
			ORDER BY @joined.info.title ASC ', 
		[ '%ing%', 'computers' ] )->xownBookList;
	
"); ?>
<p>
	In the example above, each book has an information bean
	called 'info' that contains the title of the book
	and a category bean called 'category'.
	We like to filter on category and book title - so we use the 
	<b>@joined.info.title</b> and <b>@joined.category.title</b> for the filtering.
	We also like to order the resulting records, so we add an <b>ORDER BY</b>
	clause with <b>@joined.info.title</b> (orders on the book title).
</p>


<h2>The noLoad modifier</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes, when you only want to add something to a list, there is no need to
	load the entire list. To keep RedBeanPHP from loading a list use the noLoad
	modifier as depicted in the following example:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book->noLoad()->xownPageList[] = \$newPage;
"); ?>
<p>
	This will add a new page to the list, but the initial loading
	of the list will not take place.
</p>

<h1>Counting</h1>
<p>
	Counting records is very easy with RedBeanPHP.
	For instance, to count all beans of type <i>book</i> use:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$numOfBooks = R::count( 'book' );
"); ?>
<p>
	You can use additional SQL here as well:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$numOfBooks = R::count( 'book', ' pages > ? ', [ 250 ] );
"); ?>



<h2>Count related beans</h2>
<p>
	Counting related beans is just as simple.
	To count all the pages of a 'book' bean:
</p>
<?php code("
    \$numPages = \$book->countOwn( 'page' );
");?>
<p>
	You can use the same technique for shared lists:
</p>
<?php code("
    \$numProjects = \$member->countShared( 'project' );
");?>
<p>
	You can also use withCondition() and alias():
</p>
<?php code("
    \$numProj = \$member
            ->withCondition(' member_project.role ', ['lead'] ) )
            ->countShared( 'project' );

    \$numPages = \$book
            ->withCondition( ' book_page.number > ? ', [100] )
            ->countOwn( 'page' );

    \$andy->alias( 'coAuthor' )->countOwn( 'book' );

    \$shop->via( 'relation' )->countShared( 'customer' );

"); ?>
<p>
	The first example counts all projects associated with the member
	in which the member has the 'lead' role. The second example counts
	all the pages of a book having a page number &gt; 100.
	Finally the last example demonstrates the use of an aliased list.
	Here we count the number of books written by Andy where he
	has been the co-author. All count operations return a number.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Counting something (R::count) that does not exist will not trigger an
	error but just return the number 0.
</p>

<h1>Labels, Enums, Tags</h1>

<p>
	Labels, Enums and Tags are all based on very simple beans.
	These beans only have an <b>id</b>, a <b>type</b> and a <b>name</b>.
	While they might look simple, these beans can offer various
	powerful services in your applications.
	<a href="#labels" title="labels">Labels</a> form the basis for enums and tags.
	<a href="#enums" title="enums">Enums</a> are in fact labels in a one-to-many relation while
	<a href="#tags" title="tags">Tags</a> are labels in a many-to-many relation.
</p>

<h2 id="labels">Labels</h2>
<p>
	A Label is a bean with just a name property. You can generate a batch of labels of a certain type
	using:

</p>
<?php code("
	\$labels = R::dispenseLabels( 'meals', ['pizza', 'pasta'] );
");
?>
<p>
	This will create two meal objects. Each bean will have a name property
	that corresponds to one of the strings in array.
</p>
<p>
	You can also collect the strings from label beans using:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$array = R::gatherLabels( \$meals );
");
?>
<p>
	The gatherLabels() function returns an alphabetically sorted array of strings each
	containing one name property of a bean in the bean list provided.
</p>



<h2 id="enums">Enums</h2>
<p>
	An enum type is a special bean that enables for a property to be a set of predefined values.
	To use an ENUM:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$tea->flavour = R::enum( 'flavour:english' );
"); ?>
<p>
	The ENUM method will do a lot of work here. First it checks whether there exists
	a 'flavour' bean with the name 'ENGLISH'. If this is the case, enum() will
	return this bean, otherwise it will create such a bean, store it in the database and
	return it. This way your ENUMs are created on the fly - properly. To compare an
	enum value:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$tea->flavour->equals( R::enum( 'flavour:english' ) );
");?>
<p>
	To get a list of all flavours, just omit the value part:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$flavours = R::enum( 'flavour' );
");?>
<p>
	To get a comma separated list of flavours you might want to combine
	this method with other Label Maker methods:
</p>
<?php code("
	implode( ',', R::gatherLabels( R::enum( 'flavour' ) ) );
"); ?>
<p>
	Since RedBeanPHP enums are beans you can add other properties as well.
	To query using an enum:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$flowers = R::find( 'flower', ' color_id = ? ', [ R::enum( 'color:red' )->id ] );
"); ?>
<p>
	The find query above will retrieve all red flowers. While this query is perfectly
	readable the syntax is a bit clunky, therefore there is a shorthand notation for
	the R::enum(...)-&gt;id part:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$flowers = R::find( 'flower', ' color_id = ? ', [ EID('color:red') ] );
"); ?>
<p>
	The global function EID() returns the ID of the given ENUM directly.
</p>

<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>

<p>
Tags are often used to categorize or group items.
To tag a an item:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::tag( \$page, array( 'topsecret', 'mi6' ) );
");?>
<p>
To <b>fetch all tags</b> attached to a certain bean we use the same method but without the tag parameter:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$tags = R::tag( \$page ); //returns array with tags
"); ?>
<p>
	To <b>untag</b> an item use:

</p>
<?php code("
	R::untag( \$bean, \$tagListArray );"); ?>
<p>
	To get all beans that have been tagged with $tags, use <b>tagged()</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::tagged( \$beanType, \$tagList );"); ?>
<p>
	To find out whether beans have been tagged with specific tags, use <b>hasTag()</b>:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::hasTag( \$bean, \$tags, \$all = FALSE )");?>
<p>
	To <b>add tags</b> without removing the old ones:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::addTags( \$page, ['funny', 'hilarious'] );
");?>
<p>
	To get beans that have ALL these tags:
</p>
<?php code("
	//must be tagged with both tags
	R::taggedAll( \$page, ['funny', 'hilarious'] );
");?>

<p class="note" id="countTagged">
	As of version 5.3:<br>
	To just count tags use: R::countTagged() and R::countTaggedAll().
	Same parameters.
</p>

<h1>Trees</h1>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP supports <b>self-referential</b> relationships.
	In RedBeanPHP terminology, these are called trees. Here is an example, let's decorate a christmas tree with some
	candy canes:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$cane = R::dispense('cane',10);
	\$cane[1]->ownCane = [ \$cane[2], \$cane[9] ];
	\$cane[2]->ownCane = [ \$cane[3], \$cane[4] ];
	\$cane[4]->ownCane = [( \$cane[5],
				\$cane[7], \$cane[8] ];
	\$cane[5]->ownCane = [ \$cane[6] ];
	\$id = R::store( \$cane[1] );
	\$root = R::load( 'cane', \$id );

	echo \$root->ownCane[2]->ownCane[4]
		->ownCane[5]->ownCane[6]->id;
	//outputs: 6
"); ?>
<p>
	Trees are just a special case of lists,
	you use a list with the same name as the parent type.
	In the example script above, a <b>cane</b> has an <b>ownCaneList</b>.
	Another example: <i>page-&gt;ownPageList</i>. As you can see in the example
	above you can navigate the lists using the IDs.
</p>

<h2 id="traversal">Traversal</h2>
<p>
	Instead of manually looping through each own-list of a bean you
	can use the traverse() method:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$page->traverse( 'ownPage', function( \$page ) {
		....
	} );
"); ?>
<p>
	This allows you to recursively apply a function to a list.
	To limit the results when accessing a list you can use the with/withCondition()
	method:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$page->with( ' LIMIT 10 ')->traverse( ... );
	\$page->withCondition( '  rating > ? ', [ 5 ] )->traverse( ... );
");?>
<p>
	You can also use <b>withCondition</b> and <b>alias</b> together with the traverse
	function.
	<br><br>
	Use the third parameter to specify the maximum depth:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$page->traverse( 'ownPage', \$func, 3 ); //max 3 levels
");?>
<p>
	Use the PHP <b>use</b> statement to import variables into the function scope:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$task->traverse( 'ownTask', function( \$task ) use ( &\$todos ) {
		\$todos[] = \$task->name;
	} );
"); ?>

<p class="note">
	The traverse() function does not check for <i>recursion</i> in trees.
</p>


<h2>Traversing upwards</h2>
<p>
	You can also traverse the other way around, here is a quick example:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$page = R::dispense('page');
	\$page->title = 'chapter';
	\$page2 = R::dispense('page');
	\$page2->title = 'article';
	\$page3 = R::dispense('page');
	\$page3->title = 'text';
	\$page->ownPageList[] = \$page2;
	\$page2->ownPageList[] = \$page3;
	R::store(\$page);
	\$p = \$page3->fresh();
	\$p->traverse('page', function(\$parent) {
        	echo \$parent->title. PHP_EOL;
	});
"); ?>


<h2>Importing Trees</h2>
<p>
	Do you want to import a hierarchical data structure ?
	This can be accomplished using the <a href="/import_and_export" title="Import trees with dispense().">R::dispense()</a> feature.
</p>

<h2 id="ctetrees">Faster trees (5.2+)</h2>
<p>
	If your database supports <b>common table expressions</b> (Postgres, MariaDB 10.3+) you can use
	the CTE-based tree tools as well:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$pages = R::dispense(array(
		'_type' => 'page',
		'title' => 'home',
		'ownPageList' => array(array(
			'_type' => 'page',
			'title' => 'shop',
			'ownPageList' => array(array(
				'_type' => 'page',
				'title' => 'wines',
				'ownPageList' => array(array(
					'_type' => 'page',
					'title' => 'whiskies',
				))
			))
		))
	));
 ");?>
<p>
	Given the page hierarchy of the shop above you can use
	R::parents() and R::children() like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::parents( \$whiskyPage, ' ORDER BY title ASC ' );
	//gives: home,shop,whiskies,wines
	
	R::children( \$homePage, ' ORDER BY title ASC ' ) );
	//gives:home,shop,whiskies,wines
	
	R::children( \$winePage, ' title NOT IN (\'wines\') ORDER BY title ASC ' );
	//whiskies
	
	R::parents( \$winePage, '  title NOT IN (\'home\') ORDER BY title ASC ' );
	//shop,wines
"); ?>
<p>
	Because this approach uses common table expressions the performance is much better.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Caution!
	This is a new, <b>experimental</b> feature available as of RedBeanPHP 5.2.
	The CTE API has been tested but may still contain bugs. Also the CTE API may be subject
	to change in future versions.
</p>

<h2 id="counting_in_trees">Counting in Trees (5.5)</h2>
<p>
	To count beans in trees use R::countParents() or R::countChildren.
</p>
<?php code("
	R::countParents( \$whiskyPage );
	R::countChildren( \$winePage, ' title != :title  ', [ ':title' => 'wines' ] );
"); ?>

<p id="cte_select_snippet">
	As of 5.6 you can add your own SELECT clause like 'count(distinct vendor)'.
	By default, countChildren() and countParents() subtract 1 from total number of
	counted records to exclude the starting bean. If you provide your own select
	clause (or an SQL snippet), this might not make sense, so it won't happen in that case.
</p>

<h1>Link Beans</h1>
<p>
	The following code associates an employee with a project using a
	<a href="/many-to-many" title="Learn more about a many-to-many relation.">many-to-many</a>
	relation.
</p>
<?php code("
	\$project->sharedEmployeeList[] = \$employee;
"); ?>
<p>
	The project and the
	employee are linked by a <b>link bean</b>. Link beans have their own <b>type</b>, in this case:
	<b>employeeProject</b>. In the database, these beans are stored in the <b>employee_project</b> table.
</p>



<h2 id="link">Qualified links</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes you want to qualify a relationship.
	For instance,
	in the case of projects and employees, you might want to
	add a 'role' property to the relation:
</p>
<?php code("
	list(\$e, \$p) = R::dispenseAll('employee,project');
	\$p->link( 'employee_project', [
		'role' => 'director'
	] )->employee = \$e;
"); ?>

<p>
	While this is quite handy, it's often better to introduce the missing concept:
	<b>participant</b> in this case. Often, when you find yourself qualifying a relationship,
	you might have missed an important part of your data model. A relation or link is not a
	very good substitute for this. <br>

</p>

<p class="note">
	Be careful with adding to much properties and logic to relations, make sure you haven't missed
	an important concept in your domain model.
</p>


<h2 id="access-link-beans">Accessing link beans</h2>
<p>
	Since a many-to-many relation can be viewed as a combination of
	two one-to-many relations you can access the link beans through the
	ownList on either side of the relation.
	In the case of a project-employee relations you can access the
	intermediate bean like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$employee->ownEmployeeProjectList;
"); ?>
<p>
	To remove the intermediate beans upon assigning an empty array open the
	list in exclusive mode:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$employee->xownEmployeeProjectList;
"); ?>




<h1>Other relations</h1>

<p>
	This chapter discusses less common relations.
</p>

<h2 id="aggr">Aggregations</h2>
<p>
	It's possible to treat two complementary <b>N-1</b> relations as one
	many-to-many relation, thus benefiting from the advantages of a shared list.
	In <b>RedBeanPHP 4.1+</b> you can use the <b>aggr()</b> method of a bean to collect
	the parent beans for each member of an own-list:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$targets = \$quest1->aggr( 'ownQuestTargetList', 'target', 'quest' );
"); ?>
<p>
	This code will iterate over the ownQuestionTargetList and for every
	questTarget bean in the list it will load the bean in the target property
	as a bean of type 'quest'. This relation could not have been formed as
	as shared list because a shared list does not allow aliases. Without aliases
	the relation would have been a <i>symmetrical</i> one, lacking the notion of
	direction. Another solution to this problem would be to use the shared list
	and create a <b>VIEW</b> of quest called target.
</p>



<h2>One-to-one</h2>
<p>
	One-to-one relations are not used frequently. Traditional 1-1 records are
	linked by their primary keys. Load them like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	list( \$author, \$bio ) = R::loadMulti( 'author,bio', \$id );
"); ?>
<p>
	This loads an author and a biography with the same ID.
	You need to make sure the IDs are in sync yourself.
</p>

<p class="note">
	In RedBeanPHP one-to-one relations are an <b>anti-pattern</b>, the fields
	should belong to the same bean. This method has been added for compatibility
	reasons only, try to avoid it!
</p>


<h2>Polymorph relations</h2>
<p>
	To load a bean whose type is determined by another column:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$ad = \$page->poly( 'contentType' )->content;
");
?>
<p>
	This code returns the bean referred to in <b>content_id</b> using the bean type
	specified in column <b>content_type</b>. If content_type contains the value 'advertisement'
	the content will be a bean of type 'advertisement'.
</p>
<p class="note">
	This is an <b>anti-pattern</b> in RedBeanPHP, do not use this functionality unless you have to.
	<br>
	Use poly() to retrieve polymorph data
	from an external or legacy database only.
</p>

<h1>Models</h1>
<p>
	A <b>model</b> is a place to put validation and business logic.
	Imagine a Jazz band that can only have up to 4 members.
	We could implement this rule like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	if ( count( \$members ) > 4 )
	throw new Exception( 'Too many!' );

	\$band->ownMember = \$members;
	R::store( \$band );
");?>
<p>
	However, now we need to add this check <i>everytime</i> we call R::store().
	It would be much more convenient if R::store() was smart enough to perform this
	check by itself. We can accomplish this by putting the <b>validation rule</b> in our model.
	RedBeanPHP automatically discovers the models that belong to beans, so we can
	implement this validation like this:
</p>
<?php code("

	class Model_Band extends RedBean_SimpleModel {
        	public function update() {
                if ( count( \$this->bean->ownMember ) >4 )
                throw new Exception( 'Too many members!' );
        	}
	}

	list( \$band, \$members ) = R::dispenseAll( 'band,member*5' );
	\$band->ownMember = \$members;
	R::store( \$band ); //will trigger exception

");?>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP automatically connects beans with models using a naming convention
	(i.e. Model_{TYPE OF BEAN}).
	<br>
	Now, every time we call store and something is wrong with the number of
	members, an exception will be triggered automatically.
	The mechanism that connects beans to models is called <b>FUSE</b>, because
	beans are <i>fused</i> with their models. Within a model, <b>$this-&gt;bean</b>
	refers to the bean.
	<br>
	To create a model for your bean, simply add a class like this:
</p>
<?php
code("
	//with classic namespace style
	class Model_Band extends RedBean_SimpleModel { ... }
");?>
<p>
	If you like your models to reside in the namespace
	<b>\Model</b>, you can set the following constant:
</p>
<?php code("
	//with namespace Model
	define( 'REDBEAN_MODEL_PREFIX', '\\\Model\\\' )
");?>
<p>
	You can now create a model class like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	class \Model\Band extends \RedBeanPHP\SimpleModel { ... }
");?>
<p>
	If you prefer no namespacing at all:
</p>
<?php code("
	//use plain classes (without any namespacing)
	define( 'REDBEAN_MODEL_PREFIX', '' )

	class Band extends \RedBeanPHP\SimpleModel { ... }
");?>

<p class="note">
	Beans of types like 'book_page' will search for a model
	'BookPage' first and if no such model is found they will
	try to connect to 'Book_Page'.
</p>

<h2>Scoping rules</h2>
<p>
	Within the model, the <b>$this-&gt;bean</b> variable refers to the bean.
	Simply <b>$this</b> also refers to the bean but without
	returning references, in
	practice this can be very confusing so I recommend to use
	<b>$this-&gt;bean</b>.
</p>

<h2>Fused methods</h2>
<p>
	Besides <b>update()</b> RedBeanPHP FUSE calls other methods on the model as well:
	R::store() invokes <b>update()</b> and <b>after_update()</b>,<br>
	R::load() invokes <b>open()</b>,<br>
	R::trash() invokes <b>delete()</b> and <b>after_delete()</b>,<br>
	R::dispense() invokes <b>dispense()</b>.
</p>
<p>
	Note that since loading a bean also causes a new bean to be dispensed to
	receive the record from the database, load also invokes <b>dispense()</b>.
</p>
<h2>Example: all fused methods</h2>
<p>
	To demonstrate the order and use of all of these methods let's consider
	an example:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$lifeCycle = '';
	class Model_Bandmember extends RedBean_SimpleModel {
		public function open() {
		   global \$lifeCycle;
		   \$lifeCycle .= \"called open: \".\$this->id;
		}
		public function dispense() {
		    global \$lifeCycle;
		    \$lifeCycle .= \"called dispense() \".\$this->bean;
		}
		public function update() {
		    global \$lifeCycle;
		    \$lifeCycle .= \"called update() \".\$this->bean;
		}
		public function after_update() {
		    global \$lifeCycle;
		    \$lifeCycle .= \"called after_update() \".\$this->bean;
		}
		public function delete() {
		    global \$lifeCycle;
		    \$lifeCycle .= \"called delete() \".\$this->bean;
		}
		public function after_delete() {
		    global \$lifeCycle;
		    \$lifeCycle .= \"called after_delete() \".\$this->bean;
		}
	}

	\$bandmember = R::dispense( 'bandmember' );
	\$bandmember->name = 'Fatz Waller';
	\$id = R::store( \$bandmember );
	\$bandmember = R::load( 'bandmember', \$id );

	R::trash( \$bandmember );
	echo \$lifeCycle;
");?>
<p>output:</p>
<?php code("
	called dispense() {\"id\":0}
	called update() {\"id\":0,\"name\":\"Fatz Waller\"}
	called after_update() {\"id\":5,\"name\":\"Fatz Waller\"}
	called dispense() {\"id\":0}
	called open: 5
	called delete() {\"id\":\"5\",\"band_id\":null,\"name\":\"Fatz Waller\"}
	called after_delete() {\"id\":0,\"band_id\":null,\"name\":\"Fatz Waller\"}
");?>


<h2 id="custom_fused_methods">Custom FUSED methods</h2>
<p>
	Besides the standard methods mentioned above, any method on the model
	can be invoked by calling it on the bean (assuming it does not collide with
	a native bean method):
</p>
<?php code("
	\$dog = R::dispense( 'dog' );

	//call bark() on Model_Dog:
	\$dog->bark();
"); ?>
<p>
	If you call a method on a bean that does <b>not exist</b> in the bean
	and also <b>not in the model</b> the call will be ignored. You change
	this behaviour by selecting a different FUSE error handling mechanism using
	the <b>setErrorHandlingFUSE()</b> method, see API.
</p>

<h2 id="boxing">Boxing and Unboxing</h2>
<p>
	If you have a bean and you want to obtain the corresponding model use:

</p>
<?php code("
	\$dogBean = R::dispense( 'dog' );

	//get reference to Model_Dog
	\$dogModel = \$dogBean->box();
");?>
<p>
	Similarly, if you have a model and you want its inner bean, call:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$dogBean = \$dogModel->unbox();
");?>
<p>
	We call this technique <b>boxing</b> (and unboxing). This can be handy if you want
	to make use of typehinting:
</p>
<?php code("
	public function addDog( Model_Dog \$dog ) {
		...
	}
");?>
<p>
	Otherwise, we would have to use type RedBean_OODBBean which is less descriptive.
</p>

<h2>Model Factory and Dependency Injection</h2>
<p>
	If for some reason you need to control how the bean turns into a model you
	can pass a factory function like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	use RedBeanPHP\\BeanHelper\\SimpleFacadeBeanHelper as SimpleFacadeBeanHelper;
	SimpleFacadeBeanHelper::setFactoryFunction( function( \$name ) {
		\$model = new \$name();
		\$model->setMailer( new MailLib() );
		return \$model;
	} );
"); ?>
<p>
	In this example we inject a mail library in a model using the factory function.
	For more complex scenarios you can even use the factory to pass the model to
	your own dependency injection framework.
</p>


<p class="note">
	If you need even more flexibility you can subclass the 
	<a target="_blank" href="https://redbeanphp.com/api/classes/RedBeanPHP.BeanHelper.SimpleFacadeBeanHelper.html" title="API documentation for SimpleFacadeBeanHelper">SimpleFacadeBeanHelper</a> 
	and override the <b>getModelForBean()</b> method. 
	<br><br>
	Use: <br>
	<b>R::getRedBean()-&gt;setBeanHelper( new MyBeanHelper );</b><br>
	to set the bean helper.
	<br><br>
	Don't forget to call <b>$this-&gt;loadBean( $bean )</b>;
	in the overridden method to attach the bean to the model. If you use
	the facade you have to set the bean helper for <i>every</i> database
	connection.

</p>

<p id="jsonret">
	As of RedBeanPHP 5.2 models can also return jsonSerialized objects by implementing
	the __jsonSerialize method (will override the default OODB implementation.
</p>

<h1>Meta data</h1>
<p>
	Beans contain meta data. For instance, the <b>type</b> of the bean is stored in the meta data.
	To obtain the type of a bean:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$bean->getMeta( 'type' );
");?>
<p>
	You can also store your own meta data in a bean:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$bean->setMeta( 'my.secret.property', 'secret' );
"); ?>
<p>
	this data will not get stored in the database.
</p>
<h2 id="tainted">Tainted</h2>
<p>
	Some meta data is accessible using convenience method. For instance, if you would like to
	know whether a bean has been changed since it got retrieved from the database
	use the tainted() method.
</p>
<?php code("
	\$bean->isTainted();

	//or:

	\$bean->getMeta( 'tainted' );
"); ?>
<p>
	Note that a bean is marked as tainted if a list gets <b>accessed</b>.
	You can also set the tainted flag yourself.
</p>

<h2 id="old">Old</h2>
<p>
	To determine if a certain property has changed:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book = R::load( 'book', \$id );
	\$book->hasChanged( 'title' ); //returns FALSE
	\$book->title = 'New title';
	\$book->hasChanged( 'title' ); //returns TRUE
"); ?>

<p>
	These properties will be marked as changed even if you do
	a R::store(), if you would like to clear the history
	after every store use:
</p>
<?php code("
	OODB::autoClearHistoryAfterStore( TRUE );
");?>
<p>
	To manually clear the history of a bean:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$bean->clearHistory();
");?>

<p>
	To get the old value of the property:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book->old( 'title' );
");?>
<p>
	The behaviour of hasChanged sometimes suprises people,
	for instance take a look at the following code:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$employee = R::load( 'employee', \$id );
	var_dump( \$employee->hasChanged( 'organisation' ) ); //FALSE
	var_dump( \$employee->hasChanged( 'organisation_id' ) ); //FALSE
	\$employee->organisation = \$newOrganisation;
	var_dump( \$employee->hasChanged( 'organisation' ) ); //TRUE
	var_dump( \$employee->hasChanged( 'organisation_id' ) ); //FALSE
");?>
<p>
	The reason for this behaviour is that organisation_id will
	not be updated automatically until you call R::store(). Until,
	then the property has not been changed.
</p>


<h2 id="has_list_changed">List Changed (4.2+)</h2>
<p>
	To determine whether a list has been changed (beans have been
	added or deleted):
</p>
<?php code("
	\$author->hasListChanged( 'ownBook' );
"); ?>
<p>
	This method will return TRUE if some elements of the array
	have been removed or added. Note that this method does not
	check the state of the beans themselves. It's just about the list.
</p>


<h2 id="testing_equality">Testing Equality</h2>
<p>
	To test whether two beans have the same type and <b>primary key</b> ID:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$bean->equals( \$otherBean );
"); ?>
<h2 id="empty">Empty</h2>
<p>
	To determine if a bean is empty, or only contains <b>empty</b> values
	(everything that qualifies as empty() in PHP) use:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$bean->isEmpty();
"); ?>
<h2>Copy meta data</h2>
<p>
	You can copy meta data from another bean like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$bean->copyMetaFrom( \$otherBean );
");
?>

<h2 id="masks">Meta Mask (4.3.2)</h2>
<p>
	As of version 4.3.2 you can specify a <b>meta mask</b> when
	converting rows to beans:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$rows = R::getRow( 'SELECT book.*, count( page.id ) AS meta_pages... ' );
	\$book = R::convertToBean( 'book', \$rows, 'meta_' );
	\$queryData = \$book->getMeta('data.bundle');
	echo \$queryData['meta_pages'];
"); ?>
<p>
	Here, convertToBeans will put all columns starting with 'meta_' in the
	meta section of the bean. This allows the query above to select all the
	fields of the book and query some additional meta data in the process.
	The meta data from the query will be available under the key 'data.bundle'.
</p>

<h2 id="meta_info">Info (5.6+)</h2>
<p>
	As of version 5.6, you can use info() to access data.bundle
	values directly:
</P>
<?php code("
	\$pages = \$book->info('totalNumberOfPages', 0);
"); ?>

<h1>Duplicate</h1>
<p>
	<b>R::duplicate()</b> makes a deep copy of a bean properly and without storing the bean.
	All beans in own-lists will be duplicated recursively.
	All references to shared beans will be copied but not the shared beans themselves.
	All references to parent objects (_id fields) will be copied but not the parents themselves.
	The bean will not be stored so you have the chance to modify it before saving. Usage:
</p>
<?php code("
	//entire bean hierarchy
	\$book->sharedReader[] = \$reader;
	\$book->ownPage[] = \$page;
	\$duplicated = R::duplicate( \$book ); //R::dup in RB4.0 and earlier
	//..change something...
	\$duplicated->name = 'copy!';
	//..then store...
	R::store( \$duplicated );
"); ?>
<p>
	As of <b>RedBeanPHP 4</b>, the R::duplicate() method also duplicates trees, in earlier versions
	the duplication manager skipped tree lists ($page-&gt;ownPage). Note that duplication/export won't work
	for aliased beans.
</p>
<h2 id="original_ids">ID mappings</h2>
<p>
	Curious about the old IDs of the beans that have been duplicated. You can still find them
	in the meta properties of the copied bean:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$myOldID = \$book->getMeta( 'sys.old-id' );
"); ?>

<h2 id="speed_up_dup">Performance</h2>
<p>
	Both dup() and exportAll() need to query the database schema which is slow.
	To speed up the process you can
	pass a database schema:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::getDuplicationManager()->setTables( \$schema );
");?>
<p>
	To obtain the schema use:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$schema = R::getDuplicationManager()->getSchema();
");?>
<p>
	You can now use this schema to feed it to setTables().
	R::duplicate() and R::exportAll() both use this schema.
</p>
<h2 id="duplicate">Filtering</h2>
<p>
	Don't want to duplicate every aspect of a bean? You can
	pass a white list of bean types to duplicate like this:
</p>
<?php
code("
	//only duplicates the patatoes and the tomatoes...
	R::duplicate( 'bean', ['patato', 'tomatos'] );
");
?>
<p>
	The code above only works in RedBeanPHP 4.1. In 4.0 and earlier
	you have to use R::dup() (see API for method signature).
</p>
<p class="note">
	As of RedBeanPHP 4.1 the R::dup() method is deprecated,
	use R::duplicate instead, it has a less confusing method
	signature.
</p>


<h1>Import and Export</h1>

<p>
	RedBeanPHP offers several functions to exchange data with beans.
</p>

<h2 id="import">Import</h2>

<p>
	You can import an array into a bean using:
</p>
<?php code("
    \$book->import( \$_POST );
");?>
<p>
	The code above is handy if your $_POST
	request array only contains book data.
	It will simply load all data into the book bean.
	You can also add a selection filter:
</p>
<?php code("
    \$book->import( \$_POST, 'title,subtitle,summary,price' );
");?>
<p>
	This will restrict the import to the fields specified.
	Note that this does not apply any form of <b>validation</b> to the bean.
	Validation rules have to be written in the <i>model</i> or the <i>controller</i>.
</p>
<p>
	To import from another bean:
</p>
<?php code("
    \$book->importFrom( \$otherBean );
");?>


<h2 id="import_using_dispense">Import using Dispense</h2>
<p>
	Dispense can even convert a multi dimensional array to a bean
	hierarchy like this (use _type to indicate the type of the bean):
</p>
<?php code("
	\$book = R::dispense( [
		'_type' => 'book',
		'title'  => 'Gifted Programmers',
		'author' => [ '_type' => 'author', 'name' => 'Xavier' ],
		'ownPageList' => [ ['_type'=>'page', 'text' => '...'] ]
	] );
"); ?>

<p class="note">
	R::dispense() also accepts multi dimensional arrays (4.2+)
</p>

<h2 id="export">Export</h2>
<p>
	To export the properties and values of a single bean use:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$array = \$bean->export();
");?>
<p>
	To recursively export one or an array of beans use:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$arrays = R::exportAll( \$beans );
");?>
<p>
	Bean lists in exports are keyless, 0 indexed.
	To also export parent beans:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$arrays = R::exportAll( \$beans, TRUE );
");?>


<h1>Non-static</h1>
<p>
	If you don't like static methods, you can use
	the objects behind the facade directly.
	Almost every method of the R-class is available through
	the original RedBeanPHP objects as well. The facade
	is just that: a thin layer on top of these objects.
	Here is an overview of the most important R-methods
	and how to use them 'the non-static way'.
</p>
<p>
	Note that there are three important objects in RedBeanPHP:
	the adapter (DBAdapter), the query writer (QueryWriter)
	and the RedBeanPHP object database (OODB).
	We call these objects the core objects, because together they
	represent the foundation of RedBeanPHP.
	Other objects need these core objects, that's why they are bundled in
	a toolbox (ToolBox). So, if you need let's say an instance
	of the Tag Manager class (TagManager) you'll have to
	pass an instance of the toolbox to the contructor.
</p>

<h2 id="toolbox">Toolbox</h2>
<p>	You can manually assemble your toolbox
	like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$pdo = new RPDO( \$dsn );
	\$adapter = new DBAdapter( \$pdo );
	\$writer = new MySQL( \$adapter );
	\$oodb = new OODB( \$writer );
	\$tb = new ToolBox( \$oodb, \$adapter, \$writer );
");?>


<h2 id="wiring">Wiring</h2>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP has a very decoupled architecture, which makes it very flexibile.
	However this means you need to introduce some objects to eachother.
	First we need to tell RedBeanPHP how beans can obtain the toolbox, this
	means we need to define our own BeanHelper:
</p>
<?php code("
	class BeanHelper extends SimpleFacadeBeanHelper {
        	private \$toolbox;
        	public function getToolbox() {
                	return \$this->toolbox;
        	}
        	public function setToolbox( \$toolbox ) {
                	\$this->toolbox = \$toolbox;
        	}
	}
");?>
<p class="note" id="using_interface">
	Note that we extend the SimpleFacadeBeanHelper here, if you want to implement the
	interface directly you'll have to add the methods getModelForBean() and
	getExtractedToolbox() <a href="/api/classes/RedBeanPHP.BeanHelper.SimpleFacadeBeanHelper.html" target="_blank" 
	title="Interface definition BeanHelper">as well</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Now let's do the wiring:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$r = \$tb->getRedBean();

	//A helper for OODB to give to its beans
	\$b = new BeanHelper;
	\$b->setToolbox( \$tb );
	\$r->setBeanHelper( \$b );

	//allow OODB to associate beans
	\$r->setAssociationManager(new AssociationManager( \$tb ));

	//enable FUSE
	\$h = new SimpleModelHelper;
	\$h->attachEventListeners( \$r );

");?>

<h2 id="hybrid">Hybrid</h2>
<p>
	Normally the facade does all this dull work for you.
	You can also let the facade do this work and still work with instances;
	simply steal the toolbox from the facade after it has been configured:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::setup(...);
	\$toolbox = R::getToolBox(); //give it to me!
");?>

<h2 id="service-objects">Service objects</h2>
<p>
	Many methods in the R-facade are just <i>wrappers</i> around calls to
	methods on one of these core objects: <b>OODB</b>, <b>Writer</b> and <b>Adapter</b>. However
	many static methods in R also call so-called service objects. Service
	objects offer secondary functionality. To instantiate a <i>service object</i>
	you need to pass the toolbox to its constructor. The toolbox contains everything
	service object needs to operate: the adapter to connect to the
	database, the OODB object to call basic ORM methods and the writer
	to write queries for the database.
</p>
<p>
	For instance, R::find() uses the Finder class.
	To create an instance of Finder yourself:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$f = new Finder( \$tb );
"); ?>
<p>
	That's it. Now we have an instance of the Finder service object.
	Now to find a bean use:
</p>
<?php code("
	\$x = \$f->find( 'music', ' composer = ? ', 'Bach' );
");?>

<h2>API</h2>
<p>
	This manual focuses on the facade.
	For details on individual objects, please consult the
	<a href="https://redbeanphp.com/api/namespaces/RedBeanPHP.html" title="Learn more about individual objects">API pages</a>.
</p>
<p class="note">
	Read more about the <a href="/internals" title="Internals">internals</a> of RedBeanPHP.
</p>

<h1>UUIDs</h1>
<p>
	RedBeanPHP has not been designed for use with <abbr title="Universal unique identifiers">UUIDs</abbr> or
	<abbr title="Global unique identifiers">GUIDs</abbr>. However if you really want, you can tune RedBeanPHP
	to support this.
</p>
<h2>Enabling UUID support in MySQL</h2>
<p>
	To enable <b>UUID</b> support in MySQL in fluid and frozen mode you need to provide your own
	<i>QueryWriter</i>. Here is an example of a QueryWriter that enables UUIDs in MySQL:
</p>
<?php code("
	class UUIDWriterMySQL extends MySQL {

		protected \$defaultValue = '@uuid';
		const C_DATATYPE_SPECIAL_UUID  = 97;

		public function __construct( Adapter \$adapter ) {
			parent::__construct( \$adapter );
			\$this->addDataType(
			self::C_DATATYPE_SPECIAL_UUID, 'char(36)'  );
		}

		public function createTable( \$table ) {
			\$table = \$this->esc( \$table );
			\$sql   = \"
				CREATE TABLE {\$table} (
				id char(36) NOT NULL,
				PRIMARY KEY ( id ))
				ENGINE = InnoDB DEFAULT
				CHARSET=utf8mb4
				COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci \";
			\$this->adapter->exec( \$sql );
		}

		public function updateRecord( \$table, \$updateValues, \$id = NULL ) {
			\$flagNeedsReturnID = (!\$id);
			if (\$flagNeedsReturnID) R::exec('SET @uuid = uuid() ');
			\$id = parent::updateRecord( \$table, \$updateValues, \$id );
			if (\$flagNeedsReturnID ) \$id = R::getCell('SELECT @uuid');
			return \$id;
		}

		public function getTypeForID(){
			return self::C_DATATYPE_SPECIAL_UUID;
		}
	}
");?>
<p>
	Now you need to rewire the objects to swap the old Query Writer for
	the new one:
</p>
<?php code("
		\$oldToolBox = R::getToolBox();
		\$oldAdapter = \$oldToolBox->getDatabaseAdapter();
		\$uuidWriter = new UUIDWriterMySQL( \$oldAdapter );
		\$newRedBean = new OODB( \$uuidWriter );
		\$newToolBox = new ToolBox( \$newRedBean, \$oldAdapter, \$uuidWriter );
		R::configureFacadeWithToolbox( \$newToolBox );
"); ?>
<p>
	Depending on the namespaces and aliases you use you might have to adjust
	this code accordingly.
</p>


<h2>Enabling UUID support in PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>
	To install the UUID module for <b>PostgreSQL</b> run the following query:
</p>
<?php code("
	CREATE EXTENSION \"uuid-ossp\";
"); ?>
<p>
	This command requires at least PostgreSQL version <b>9.1</b>, for earlier versions of
	Postgres please consult their documentation.
</p>
<p>
	Here is an example class for PostgreSQL:
</p>
<?php code("
	class UUIDWriterPostgres extends PostgreSQL {

		protected \$defaultValue = 'uuid_generate_v4()';
		const C_DATATYPE_SPECIAL_UUID  = 97;

		public function __construct( Adapter \$adapter ){
			parent::__construct( \$adapter );
			\$this->addDataType( self::C_DATATYPE_SPECIAL_UUID, 'uuid'  );
		}

		public function createTable( \$table ){
			\$table = \$this->esc( \$table );
			\$this->adapter->exec( \"
			CREATE TABLE \$table (id uuid PRIMARY KEY); \" );
		}

		public function getTypeForID(){
			return self::C_DATATYPE_SPECIAL_UUID;
		}
	}
"); ?>
<p>
	These are just examples, they allow you to use UUID but they
	may not fit your needs. I recommend to craft your own Query Writer,
	tailored to your needs.
</p>

<h1>Templates</h1>
<p>
	As of RedBeanPHP 5.6 you can use data definition language templates to
	make sure RedBeanPHP constructs its tables according to your specifications.
	For instance, if you want to construct your MySQL tables using the
	option <a title="MySQL Row Format Options" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-row-format.html" target="_blank">ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC</a>
	you can alter the DDL template for table creation
	like this:
</p>

<?php code("
	\$writer->setDDLTemplate( 'createTable', '*',  
		\$writer->getDDLTemplate('createTable', '*') . ' ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC '
	);
"); ?>

<p>
	Currently, RedBeanPHP supports overriding the following DDL templates: 'createTable' 
	(used by RedBeanPHP for table creation),
	'addColumn' (used by RedBeanPHP to add a new column to a table on-the-fly) and
	'widenColumn' (used by RedBeanPHP to adjust the column to hold a different kind of data).
</p>

<h1>Prefixes</h1>
<p>
	In RedBeanPHP, the <b>underscore</b> '_' 
	is used to denote a <b>relation</b> between two tables.
	For instance a table 'book_tag' is used to associate books with tags.<br>
	So, if you want to use table prefixes like 'cms_' or 'tbl_' you'll have to
	<i>bypass</i> the RedBeanPHP schema policy check like this:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::ext('xdispense', function( \$type ){ 
		return R::getRedBean()->dispense( \$type ); 
	});
"); ?>
<p>
	Now you can use an underscore in your bean <b>type</b>:
<?php code("
	\$page = R::xdispense( 'cms_page' );
"); ?>
<p>
	However, the name of the type still looks odd. Using a <b>constant</b>,
	you can improve the readability of this code:
</p>
<?php code("
	define( 'PAGE', 'cms_page' );
	\$page = R::xdispense( PAGE );
");?>
<p>
	This also works for relations:
</p>
<?php code("
	define( 'PAGES', 'ownCms_page' );
	\$pages = \$site->{PAGES};
"); ?>
<p>
	Here is a complete example:
</p>
<?php code("
	//Define your mappings like this
	define( 'POEM', 'tbl_poem' );
	define( 'BOOK', 'tbl_book' );
	define( 'AUTHOR', 'tbl_author' );
	define( 'CATEGORY', 'tbl_category' );
	define( 'POEMS', 'ownTblPoem' );
	define( 'CATEGORIES', 'sharedTblCategory' );

	//Create an extension to by-pass security check in R::dispense
	R::ext('xdispense', function( \$type ){
		return R::getRedBean()->dispense( \$type );
	});

	//Use tbl_book_category instead of tbl_book_tbl_category
	R::renameAssociation([
		'tbl_book_tbl_category' => 'tbl_book_category' 
	]);

	//Use them like this:
	\$poem = R::xdispense( POEM );
	\$poem->title = 'Trees';
	\$author = R::xdispense( AUTHOR );
	\$author->name = 'Joyce Kilmer';
	\$book = R::xdispense( BOOK );
	\$book->title = 'Trees and other poems';
	\$category = R::xdispense( CATEGORY );
	\$category->name = 'nature';
	\$book->{AUTHOR} = \$author;
	\$book->{POEMS}[] = \$poem;
	\$book->{CATEGORIES}[] = \$category;
	\$id = R::store( \$book );

	//For testing purposes let's output something:
	\$book = R::load( BOOK, \$id );
	\$poem = reset( \$book->{POEMS} );
	\$author = \$book->{AUTHOR};
	\$category = reset( \$book->{CATEGORIES} );

	echo \"Have you ever read '{\$poem->title}' ({\$book->title}) by {\$author->name} ?
	it's a beautiful poem about {\$category->name}.\";
"); ?>
<p>
	This code will output:
</p>
<kbd>
	Have you ever read 'Trees' (Trees and other poems) by Joyce Kilmer ?
	it's a beautiful poem about nature.
</kbd>

<p>
	Use the R::renameAssociation method to select a proper name for the
	association table.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Note that using table prefixes can be quite <b>dangerous</b>,
	especially if you use them to avoid having to create multiple databases:
	mixing data from <b>multiple clients</b> in one database can cause serious
	security issues !
</p>

<p class="note">
	Another way to map tables is to use VIEWS of course.
	This is an even simpler approach but it might affect performance.
</p>

<h2>Using multiple schemas</h2>
<p>
	If you use Postgres you can devide your databases in multiple
	'schemas'.
	Simply tell RedBeanPHP where to look for its beans using the 'search path':

<h1>Query Builder</h1>
<p>
	You might notice this page is very short... <br>
	RedBeanPHP does not offer a <b>Query Builder</b>. The reason for this is that I
	like to keep things <b>simple</b>. RedBeanPHP uses good old 'plain SQL'. Nothing fancy.
	There is no new syntax to learn, no Query Objects, not an SQL dialect, nothing.
	<br>
	Query Builders can be quite <b>complex</b> and you have to judge for
	yourself whether this additional complexity is <i>justified</i> or not.
	<br>
	Also, the choice for a certain Query Builder is highly <b>subjective</b>, it
	depends on personal preferences.
</p>

<p>
	So, no Query Builder in RedBeanPHP. However, on this page I offer some
	suggestions for those of you searching for a Query Builder. Feel free to mail
	me if you have some suggestions of your own.
</p>

<h2>Dark Roast</h2>
<p>
	<b>Dark Roast</b> is a Query Builder created by Twiggler. It's a very complete
	Query Builder attempting to abstract SQL away. It has many interesting
	features for those who like the concept of a Query Builder. It can even
	work on <b>arrays</b> instead of a database making it easy to <b>mock</b> the database.

<h2>Tiniest Query Builder in the World</h2>
<p>
	I am not sure whether this is Query Builder at all.
	Maybe it's no more than just a <i>'string builder'</i>. <br>
	I have written this one
	myself, I use it for complex dynamic queries (search forms):

<h1>LOBs</h1>

<p>
	<b>LOBs</b> are <i>large objects</i>. The term refers to special database 
	<i>column types</i> and
	<i>functions</i> for dealing with large 
	chunks of unstructured data, like <i>photos</i>.
</p>

<h2>No Support</h2>
<p>
	<b>RedBeanPHP</b> does <b>not</b> offer support for <b>LOBS</b>.
	<br>
	However it's possible
	to leverage LOB functions of your database through the <b>PDO</b> object which
	can be accessed like this:
<p>
<?php code("
	R::getDatabaseAdapter()->getDatabase()->getPDO();
"); ?>


<h2>Advantages/Disadvantages LOBs</h2>
<p>
	Storing files as LOBs in the database has some advantages.
	The most important advantage of using LOBs this way is to have
	<i>data integrity</i> and <i>transactions</i> for files.
</p>
<p>
	Using LOBs comes at a price though. You're databases will become
	<b>quite large</b> which makes it hard to backup them or move them around.
	Another possible drawback is that your files cannot be served from
	a <b>cache layer</b>, due to the fact they are <i>tucked away</i> in the database.
	Some people might argue you're using the <i>wrong tool for the job</i>:
	a file system is for files, a database is for records. I am not
	sure how important this philosophical consideration is in practice though.
</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>
	There are alternatives to using LOBs.
	One solution is to store the <b>path</b> to the file in the database and
	the actual file on disk. If you're worried about data integrity you can
	also rename the file to a <b>hash</b> and store the hash in the database.
</p>

<h1>Migrations</h1>
<p>
	After a release you might add new features to your application in your development
	environment. New columns and tables may also be added. At that point the database structures
	of production and development environments are <b>out-of-sync</b>. Normally you would solve this
	problem with <b>migration scripts</b>. These are little SQL scripts generated on your development
	box that can sync the database structure. With RedBeanPHP this is often not needed. The easiest
	way to solve the migration issue with RedBeanPHP is just to temporarily turn on fluid mode for a single
	script and have RedBeanPHP create the missing tables and columns for you in the production environment.
</p>
<h2>Fluid Migrations</h2>
<p>
	To make the above work you need to be a little strategic about the PHP scripts you write.
	The easiest way is to have a single script for adding new tables. This script can also make the new
	tables and columns for you on the production server. Don't forget to only temporary enable
	fluid mode on a production server (and add IP-restriction, recommended!). You can temporarily
	re-activate fluid mode using:
</p>
<?php code("
	R::freeze(FALSE);
"); ?>
<p>
	Don't forget to remove this line after the script has been executed and the required columns and tables
	have been generated.
</p>

<h2>Migration Logger</h2>
<p>
	Another option is to create your own logger by extending one of the default Logging classes.
	You can then make your logger write any query that contains phrases like 'ALTER TABLE' or 'CREATE TABLE'
	to a file. As such this solution kind of creates an SQL trail: a trail of queries reflecting the
	changes RedBeanPHP has applied to your database schema. Here is an example implementation
	of a migration logger:
</p>
<?php code("

class MigrationLogger implements Logger {

	private \$file;

	public function __construct( \$file ) {
		\$this->file = \$file;
	}

	public function log() {
		\$query = func_get_arg(0);
		if (preg_match( '/^(CREATE|ALTER)/', \$query )) {
			file_put_contents( \$this->file, \"{\$query};\\n\",  FILE_APPEND );
		}
	}
}
"); ?>
<p>
	and this is how to wire it:
</p>
<?php code("

\$ml = new MigrationLogger( sprintf( '/tmp/migration_%s.sql', date('Y-m-d') ) );

R::getDatabaseAdapter()
	->getDatabase()
	->setLogger(\$ml)
	->setEnableLogging(TRUE);
"); ?>

<p>
	The example above will create a file like:
</p>
<kbd>
/tmp/migration_2017-09-27.sql
</kbd>

<p>
	the file may contain something like:
</p>

<kbd>
CREATE TABLE `book` ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT ) ;<br>
ALTER TABLE `book` ADD `title` TEXT ;
</kbd>
